					<description><![CDATA[I think a simple revert of something like this would be allowable under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vandalism policy&lt;/a&gt;, even if it&#039;s to your own article. It&#039;s a pretty clear example of what the policy calls &quot;silly vandalism.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have not read with full details the policies about edition of pages with interests, but I guess that reverting the version to the unvandalized one (I didn&#039;t say &quot;editing&quot;) and posting full disclosure in the revert message would not be against the policies. At least when the vandalism is spam or obvious namecalling.

The original contents remains as old versions, where they can be restated, and if the commit message is clear and transparent I see no harm. There is a gray area in there, but I think removing a couple of teenager-style insults from a page is clearly in the white side of any policy discussion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the problem is you should try freaking in a tighter manner than you currently freak. I&#039;m not criticizing you, I certainly understand the attraction, I used to freak extremely loosely, ex-treme-ly! But I found that my freakishly long legs were overturning much of my furniture when I did so, and as a consequence I was forced to redevelop my personal freaking style. Now I freak much better than ever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The right thing to do about a page describing yourself is almost always nothing.  There are plenty of Wikipedians, human and mechanical, who look for such things and fix them.  If things have gone on too long unfixed, add a note to the talk page.

That said, I am the author of the John Cowan article, though the John Cowan described there is not me, and I know little about him.  At the same time I removed links to John Cowan in contexts that meant me, as I don&#039;t consider myself notable enough.]]></description>

And, just for the record, although I&#039;m &quot;in or near Raleigh, North Carolina,&quot; it wasn&#039;t me that vandalized!!]]></description>
