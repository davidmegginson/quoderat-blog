					<description><![CDATA[Nice post.  I&#039;ll add one that seems equally obvious to me:

1. It&#039;s cruel and barbaric to put to death even convicted murderers.
2. It&#039;s enlightened and sensitive to allow putting to death innocent unborn.

(Obviously this hinges on the belief that the unborn are not yet persons - at best, an unprovable assertion.  Yet strangely this belief is dogmatically held by the very folks whom I would expect to err on the side of caution with respect to life and human rights.)

3 of the 4 combinations seem logically defensible here, but the most popular one seems to be the least defensible.]]></description>
