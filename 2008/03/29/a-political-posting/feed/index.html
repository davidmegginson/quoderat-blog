					<description><![CDATA[It probably starts with asking &quot;What would happen if we just up and left?&quot;  and then working your way from there.

It&#039;s not about intelligence and intentions so much as being disciplined about fully understanding the situation, countermeasures and trade-offs.  Status quo is always easier and yet has no guarantee of being better.]]></description>
