					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be very happy to see the SOA acronym be publicly executed and buried in a deep hole, so I hope the *term* is DOA.  I like the idea of salvaging the useful bits that emerged from the SOA hype, but I suspect there are radically divergent opinions on what they are -- every time this permathread cluster re-emerges, we agree to disagree on overarching principles but agree that most of these ideas have applicability in specific domains - even the much-scorned RPC in 3-tier architectures.

Sean says &quot;The industry only has itself to blame....Now the market thinks the tech. companies are pulling a stunt and they are largely right.&quot;  I for one blame the analysts, not tech companies.  The analysts make their living inventing over-arching concepts and then going around to explain what they really mean, and how EII is really very different from the old-fashioned idea of EAI, and how an ESB is quite different from a MOM, ad nauseum. I see the tech companies (at least the smaller ones) jumping thru the analysts&#039; hoops on this stuff, trying hard not to be stuck in the &quot;lower-left quadrant&quot; by failing to ride the buzzword bandwagon.

I very much agree that &quot; Trying to convince customers that all the temporally coupled, three tiered architectures they had where, in reality,special cases of a beautiful new over-arching theory called SOA, has backfired.   The dangerous bit here is the attempt to erect an over-arching theory over heterogenous reality.  REST is another over-arching theory and needs to be treated with just as much skepticism. so that we don&#039;t jump  from the SOA frying pan into the REST fire.

Question for those who remember the gool ol&#039; days better than I do:  Didn&#039;t we go thru much the same hype / confusion cycle with OO in the early &#039;90s?  Wasn&#039;t OO declared DOA at some point early on when the &quot;software ICs&quot; vision didn&#039;t materialize and the religious disputes of the  sort  &quot;should a square be a subclass of rectangle&quot; starting breaking out?  Wasn&#039;t C++ just as much of a hideous mass of misbegotten complexity as WS-* (and just as hated by the Smalltalk / Eiffel purists)?

There is little doubt that the &quot;services revolution&quot; (if it happens) will be seen in retrospect as underwhelming as the &quot;OO revolution&quot; does today ... but that&#039;s quite a ways from saying that it is DOA.]]></description>
