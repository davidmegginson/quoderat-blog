					<description><![CDATA[I used to have the same opinion as you, until I read an article on the subject a few weeks ago (sorry, I don&#039;t have the URL at the moment).  Basically the point the article made was that in order to be database-agnostic, you basically have to target the lowest common denomiator - nothing more than simple SQL.  Every database has its own strong points, its own unique APIs and abilities, and so on, and if you ignore these, you&#039;re not using your tools to their full potential.

It&#039;s a good point.  Why limit your application, in terms of power and especially performance, by not using your database to its fullest potential?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another factor is that mysql is ubiquitous among the most affordable web site hosting providers (though this might raise a chicken-or-egg question). You generally need to spend a bit more money to store your data in something else, probably by paying for a dedicated or colocated server and administering the alternative DBMS yourself. So most potential users - and, quite likely, the project&#039;s developers themselves, if they don&#039;t want to host the project from their bedrooms or offices - only have access to mysql.

(Contradictory evidence in the form of listings of comparably priced web hosting providers who support postgresql would be most welcome.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s performance and bloat issues with the database abstraction classes out there. One we looked at was bigger than WordPress itself!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hear Hear!  I&#039;m quite distressed at having to install an &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress-pg.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an entirely different project&lt;/a&gt; just to get wordpress working with my database.  And by the sound of things, WP 1.5 won&#039;t be any better.  :-(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a DBI type of module in PEAR called PEAR::DB (a possibly more original name than DBI :-)) that does just that. The comany I work in has a web app in PHP written with this, developed against MySQL and deployed in MS SQL Server and Oracle without much problems. You can find it at http://pear.php.net/package/DB.
I guess most PHP developers just don&#039;t care enough to use it. It requires a certain discipline to stay in the standard SQl specs.]]></description>
