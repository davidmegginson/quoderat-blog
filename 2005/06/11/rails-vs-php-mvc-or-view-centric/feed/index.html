					<description><![CDATA[[...] I find the last point especially interesting. OO works well for developing many types of interactive applications, but maybe that&#8217;s just a fluke, and its principles are not applicable to the world at large. I&#8217;ve already mentioned that I find OO a poor fit for database-driven webapps, even though I consider myself primarily an OO developer. The real world doesn&#8217;t fit nicely into class hierarchies (yes, I know about aspect-oriented programming; in fact, I remember something similar for LISP called &#8220;facets&#8221; from late 1970&#8217;s or early 1980&#8217;s AI literature).

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;&#062; I think that the answer has to do with the fact that web applications — whether producing HTML for people or XML for machines — are really about views, not objects. In anything but the most trivial cases, the views involve information from many different types of objects merged together to create a new object type.
---
I would disagree with that. Maybe my programming has not been proper MVC, but I have found that for something more complex than a couple of webpages put together - I spent about 6 months helping convert a legacy Foxpro app to PHP/MySQL - the separation is essential.
Imagine - we had like 10 developers in 3 countries, all trying to convert different parts of an around 120 screen Foxpro app (they defined the job amount by the &quot;screens&quot; converted).
Not separating Model into classes independant of controller/view pages would have been suicidal.

A typical page that user would call, would fulfill the role of Controller - getting input, validating it, and then depending on input and general app state, calling the appropriate actions in different models, assembling all the presentation info received into a structure, which then gets passed to a View (we used Smarty for Views, and it worked quite OK).

something like (pseudoPHP):

AddressEntryManagement.php (controller class):
...
if (user input action is delete &#038;&#038; $id is sane and some other checks)
{
   $addr = new AddressEntry($id);
   $addr-&#062;delete();
   $VIEW[&#039;result&#039;]=&#039;Success&#039;;
}
... // other actions

$tpl= new Smarty(&#039;AddressEntry.tpl&#039;);

$tpl-&#062;assign(&#039;DATA&#039;,$VIEW);
$tpl-&#062;display();
=============
not entirely proper MVC maybe, but definitely loads better than the default approach used of simply making all the DB calls in the same place as presentation and controller.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[what is better ??
 this type of questions are not applicable in the software field , because the best is the best for that particular problem as an example my company is devoloping e-learning materials and tools and we devoloped all the projects using php becase
1- the all team knew it very well.
2- whe were dealing the database in a very low level.
3- we dealed with multimedia files in very low level format , creating swf,image and audio files from php.

after we produced our application we needed to have all those tools as a cd based applcation so we crafted apache,mysql,php together and with some addiotional exe&#039;s whalllla we had a custom version that works in a cd.

could this be done in ruby ??? i doubt but it still possibel.
does that make ruby bad ??? of course no but in this particular situation i think it would be a bad choice]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[PHP feels good by accepting that you don&#039;t have to hide the SQL.
For persistent &#039;objects&#039; I like visible SQL (queries and views for your abstractions). PHP is scalable as long as your SQL is scalable.

In Java I like iBatis instead of Hibernate.
Comes down to &#039;I use PHP/Ruby/Java whatever to acces my SQL data&#039; versus &#039;I use SQL to store my PHP/Ruby/Java objects&#039;.
What I find lacking in object oriented programming are (SQL) views. In SQL I can combine several tables/queries into one view and then treat that view as the basis for other queries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] So for a long time have been avoiding anything MVC and sticking to page centric designs because they work and stuff get&#8217;s done.

					<description><![CDATA[Eventhough I haven&#039;t used Ruby on Rails, I have seen their promotion video. Been on PHP boat since 2002, and I must say It&#039;s just up to you! It&#039;s OO now with PHP5 and it has matured to the level that it&#039;s become enterprise level. Check Zend.com the official &#038; commercial back of PHP. Lately IBM, Oracle, and others been partnering with Zend for PHP integration. SAP is in the game too! And with introduction of Zend Platform there is no excuse why not to use PHP.

PHP5 has all that you&#039;re used on in Java, XML libraries, unicode, and many MVC frameworks that are available and waiting for you to grab them such as Mojavi, ZNF, Prado, BlueShoes, etc...

And if you&#039;re worried about IDE or deployment tools, then check out Zend Studio at Zend.com

One very important point about PHP is that it&#039;s joint the big players, we&#039;ve got PHP certification now!

To conclude, use what makes sense for your job, project, and prefrence. I beleive you could never compare apples &#038; oranges! Rails is a framework while PHP is a language and a platform.]]></description>
