					<description><![CDATA[[...] A short while ago, I wrote about how my megginson.com domain has suffered severe collateral damage from security flaws in Microsoft Outlook, even though I&#8217;ve never used the product and do not run Windows. Today, I noticed that my IP address had changed, and that I was not seeing the site (due to a stale DNS cache, I think). Here&#8217;s what my hosting service wrote in reply (with the name of my other domain XXX&#8217;d out):  The domain megginson.com is on a different IP than XXXXX.com. The site is working just fine; we had to move your site a few days ago to a dedicated IP due to the excessive email spamming that was still coming in that was targeting your A record rather than your MX record. You were averaging over 500,000 pieces of spam a day even after you moved your email offsite as a result of the A Record targeting. The move to a dedicated IP allowed us to block all port 25 traffic on that IP to augment the incoming spam. [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You may or may not find yourself chuckling at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000393.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this nugget&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dan Sugalski&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now I’m looking at a wad of virus-generated mail bounced back to me because it failed an &lt;abbr title=&quot;Sender Policy Framework&quot;&gt;SPF&lt;/abbr&gt; check at the receiver’s end.

Yep, that’s right. Someone configured their mail server to check and see if inbound mail had a forged From address and, if it found that it was, bounce it back. Back to the forged from. You know, the one you just checked and found that it didn’t come from.

Some days people truly puzzle me.&lt;blockquote&gt;

And then there is, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wgz.com/chromatic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;chromatic&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3682&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;One Question Certification Tests for E-Mail Filter Authors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
