Technically, you are correct.  And yet.  Both ByteArrayInputStream.read() and CharArrayReader.read() throw IOException.  This is done to enable composition and swapping.  For instance, I sometimes use handcoded stuff in unit tests.  The advantages outweigh the minor annoyances.  So I agree with David Megginson on this one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[XML parsing is not I/O, and a SAXException is not a kind of IOException. This one you got right. Consider the case of an XML document stored in a String literal. The XOM unit test suite is loaded with these things. No I/O needs to be performed to parse them. Everything already exists within memory. Parsing is a completely separate operation from input and output, and it should be logically separate. Parsing is defined to operate on a sequence of bytes or characters. We often choose to represent that sequence as a stream for the sake of convenience and efficiency. However, we don&#039;t need to. Parsing would work equally well if the data were represented as a byte array, char array, or something else.

There&#039;s also the issue that even parsing a string may cause I/O to be done if an external DTD subset needs to be loaded. However, again the parsing of the XML and the input and output of that XML are two different operations. Problems in one are not problems in the other. They are conceptually distinct.]]></description>
