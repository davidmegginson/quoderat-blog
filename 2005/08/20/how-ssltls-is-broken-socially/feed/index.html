					<description><![CDATA[I wish. :-( I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s not a subject of direct interest for me. I remember the figure because I was impressed by the discrepancy every time I saw a mention in an article in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heise.de/ix/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;iX&lt;/a&gt; (or maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heise.de/ct/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;c&#8217;t&lt;/a&gt;; they&#8217;re &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; two German computer magazines). I at least skim almost everything they write about, whether it&#8217;s of direct interest or not. This number came up at least thrice over time. Shame that I don&#8217;t have the first clue where to go looking for a citation&#8230; :-(

It would be in German anyway, but it would provide a starting point at least, whereas all my attempts to wrestle something out of Google were in vain. The obvious keyword combinations result in a sea of vendor ads and product whitepapers, but nothing of value.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a great comment, Aristotle -- thanks.  I would have expected to see a difference of around one order of magnitude, not three.  Can you point me to a good source where I can get more performance information?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#8217;t forget another factor: encryption requires a protracted handshake and lots of CPU cycles. The peak simultaneous request rate that a webserver can handle is typically &lt;em&gt;three orders of magnitude&lt;/em&gt; greater for unencrypted connections than for encrypted ones.

Since each connection has to be encrypted invidually, you can&#8217;t just throw cheap machines doing reverse proxy duties at the problem either &#8211; the easiest to maintain and most cost effective way to scale a service. You need big, expensive hardware, because servers pushing encrypted content down the wire end up CPU-bound, not I/O-bound.

For low-volume sites, the problem isn&#8217;t even on the radar. But for small outfits running sites with moderate but not insignificant traffic, it is a serious concern. You have to choose carefully how much content is served securely; encryption unfortunately isn&#8217;t free.]]></description>
