					<description><![CDATA[Glad you like the paper. Note that Ed was actually ad Edinburgh University at the time of writing; I believe NeSC should get some credit for funding him.

regarding doc/lit vs. rpc/enc, the generation-1 stacks were all rpc-encoded; JAX-RPC is essentially built on that world view as is .NET 1.x; it is the only way to serialize a graph of native objects, rather than build a tree-style message. But the future belongs to doc/lit, as it avoids so many interop problems related to interpretation of the soap section 5 encoding.
