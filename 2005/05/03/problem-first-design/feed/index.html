					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Real problems&quot; sounds &lt;a href=&quot;http://koranteng.blogspot.com/2005/03/rest-intervention.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;just about right&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://koranteng.blogspot.com/2005/03/rest-intervention.html&quot;&gt;
The following tidbit from another context seems strangely relevant here:

Oliver Hass, a 28 year-old chemist and graduate student from Oldenberg, Germany, wrote me recently about what the President&#039;s trip looked like to him. In introducing himself, Hass commented on &quot;how necessary it can be for a chemist to forget about molecules and think about real problems.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[-1.  Funny how both Tim and Norm say &quot;WSDL&quot; is too complicated, but don&#039;t show what the WSDL 2.0 of their examples would look like.  Instead, they propose throwing out WSDL 2.0 and replacing with their own syntaxes, yet we can&#039;t compare them to WSDL 2.0.  WSDL 2.0 has finished it&#039;s first last call period, there&#039;s a longstanding and devoted Sun rep (hi Roberto!), and two prominant Sun folks are taking potshots at WSDL 2.0 without submitting Last Call comments.  Seems bogus to me, and Roberto has my sympathies.]]></description>
