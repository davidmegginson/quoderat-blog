					<description><![CDATA[The reason WebDAV doesn&#039;t provide what you want is that it is a file-server protocol like FTP, which assumes that the client is in control of the names used on the file space.  When you write a file to some network drive, you are expected to specify the name it will have on that drive.  If someone else has already written a file with that name, &lt;i&gt;tant pis&lt;/i&gt; &#8212; and if someone else comes along and writes a file with that same name after you, you lose.

In general, the model of POST, when properly used in a REST style, is that the server makes up the URL of the new entry and tells the client about it.  There is nothing to prevent the client from providing a hint, but I don&#039;t think it makes sense for the hint to be in the URL itself.   Rather the URL should point to a container where the new object will reside, and you&#039;ll get back an extended URL specifying the new object&#039;s server-created name appended to the container URL.]]></description>
