					<description><![CDATA[For me, the main point is that open standards ensure that the switching costs are extremely low — I can afford to risk going with a no-pay app today, because I can easily switch to another no-pay (or pay) app tomorrow.  None of my data is locked into feedly, and none will disappear if feedly disappears.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m surprised you would choose to support another &#039;free&#039; app. Part of the reason that Reader disappeared is that there wasn&#039;t a financial incentive to keep it running. I decided to put my support behind NewsBlur; it offered all the features of Feedly but has a subscription fee. But the cost is a mere $24 per year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a convoluted way of working!
To avoid giving them my login, I create a new gmail account (does Google own feedly?), import my reader opxml, then use that throwaway ac as my feedly ac? How strange.]]></description>

Odd. Using Chrome on Linux. Login takes me to the &#039;request for permission&#039; page... I say no and I&#039;m back to the home page? From there, no way to add an opml list? #reader]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dave: on Android, Feedly didn&#039;t ask for that; instead, it just asked for permission to access my account via OAuth, and then, only when I asked it to sync with Google Reader.  I just verified that it&#039;s not listed on https://accounts.google.com/IssuedAuthSubTokens , so the access was a one-off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s changed any, but when I started using Feedly (on iOS) it would sync perfectly with Google Reader so I wouldn&#039;t get duplicates or missed articles if I read sometimes with Feedly on iOS and sometimes with Google Reader on the desktop.  These days I&#039;ve got the Feedly Chrome app so I&#039;m using Feedly on laptop, desktop, iOS and Android, and it sync perfectly.]]></description>
