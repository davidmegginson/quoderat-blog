&quot; otherwise, people can’t share links to your stories and let others discover your paper, and in 2013, reading the news has become a highly-social activity.&quot;
  London Times. Has an iPad app. Available on line BUT... If I think X would be interested, AFAIK they won&#039;t be able to access the item (behind a paywall). I think the NYT has got round this somehow and I know the Times (Ldn) are asking if viewers want this (duh!). 

Bottom line we want access to, and to be able to share, information. Paywalls et al are just a nuisance.]]></description>

Thanks for the comment, Dave.  The newspaper is a good example: reading it is a high-frequency activity (tall head) when it&#039;s your local paper, and a low-frequency/dispersed (long tail) activity when it&#039;s someone else&#039;s local paper.  I&#039;d suggest that in that case, an app is a nice-to-have, but web site (preferably mobile-friendly) remains a need-to-have; otherwise, people can&#039;t share links to your stories and let others discover your paper, and in 2013, reading the news has become a highly-social activity.

I&#039;ll also go off topic from Dave&#039;s comment, and rant about the severely-broken practice of using separate URLs for mobile and desktop (e.g. www.somenewspaper.com vs m.somenewspaper.com).  If I share the link from my phone, someone reading the article on a laptop at work doesn&#039;t want to be stuck with the mobile UI on a huge screen, and if that person shares the link from work, I don&#039;t want to be stuck with a tiny postage stamp of the 3-column desktop site on my phone.  Newspapers: just don&#039;t do that, ever, if you give a sh*t about attracting readers.  ]]></description>
