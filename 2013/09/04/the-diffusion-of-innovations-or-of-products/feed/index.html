Thanks, Dave. I&#039;m not sure I have the right words yet, either, but I&#039;m glad you were able to understand what I was trying to write.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;what people do, not what people buy&quot; 
&quot; difference between innovation ... and product &quot;
Fully agree you have a very good point David. Not sure it&#039;s captured by the terms you use, and there certainly is a clear curve around adoption of a new product, as seen generally by sales figures. It&#039;s likely a bell curve too, but so too are so many natural things. 

IMHO the first is closer to capturing the idea, but I can&#039;t better it in a phrase. 
Thanks. DaveP]]></description>
