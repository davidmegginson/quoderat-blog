					<description><![CDATA[Hi David, 

Just came across this comparison of yours between Amazon EC2 vs Google App Engine. Great article. Wanted to know if you&#039;d like to feature it on getcomparisons.com? A project we’ve started to house all the best product comparisons on the web under one roof. You can back-link to this original article of course. Check it out, and if you&#039;re interested, I will send you an invite.

Cheers,
Akshay Arabolu, Founder]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My take (admittedly I&#039;m biased, since I&#039;m on the App Engine team): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I suspect that for many users, the ability to just drop in an app without having to spend weeks messing around with JVM-limited language ports[...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of App Engine&#039;s major advantage is that you don&#039;t have to spend weeks messing around with server configuration, replication, failover, backups, monitoring, and so forth - it&#039;s much more drop-in than a bare server offering can be.

I think, though, that most of the advantages of the new micro instances will be complementary to App Engine, not in competition. Two things spring immediately to mind:
1. Micro instances provide a perfect hosting platform for TyphoonAE, an independent implementation of the App Engine platform. Users wanting to move low traffic apps off App Engine can set up a micro instance running TyphoonAE, and avoid having to modify their code.
2. Micro instances also provide a perfect platform for doing &#039;offline work&#039; for App Engine apps at relatively low volumes. Suppose, for example, that your app generally fits well on App Engine, but you have a few things, such as image recognition or processing, or video transcoding, that require facilities not available on App Engine. A micro instance may be exactly what you need in the way of minimal, low-cost server resources to perform this batch work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You also need to factor in the US$0.10 per GiB per month and the US$0.10 per million I/O operations for Elastic Block Storage (replicated raw hard disks) if you want a drop-in replacement.  Amazon says a &quot;medium-sized web database&quot; with 100 GiB would probably cost another US$36 per month in EBS charges, so that&#039;s $50/month, plus S3 charges for backup (you can back up EBS disks to S3 in compressed form).  Still cheap and scalable, but not &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; as cheap as it sounded before.]]></description>
