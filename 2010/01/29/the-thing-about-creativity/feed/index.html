					<description><![CDATA[BigLinuxGuy: you&#039;re saying pretty-much what I said in the posting -- there&#039;s no need for the iPad to support software development.

					<description><![CDATA[You know, one of the things I&#039;ve never quite understood is why that people think the iPad is a developers&#039; laptop replacement. It&#039;s not even aimed there, yet everyone compares it to a netbook that they can code on. It&#039;s meant to be a consumer device, not a computer. Your point is equivalent to saying that you should be able to write code on your remote control or home heating and air system control panel.

If you really want to program on it, install the ssh terminal and connect to a server. Voila! You&#039;re writing code on your iPad which keeps you legal with the terms of the iPad EULA.

BTW, nobody is making anyone buy the iPad, especially if they don&#039;t like the terms associated with it. Wait for the Android tablet and hack away to your hearts content.]]></description>
