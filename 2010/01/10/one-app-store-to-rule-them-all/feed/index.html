					<description><![CDATA[Part of it has to do with size: apps are small things, though they may have large generic datasets backing them.

Small means hacker-friendly (hacker in the sense of a quick and perhaps dirty programmer, not in the sense of a breaker-in.)

A program that only needs one idea, that is easy to implement, that can be reworked without pain, that can go viral or at least be appreciated by friends, and perhaps that can make money, it is no wonder it is attractive. Modularity trumps standards?

We have seen the same thing with web pages and postage stamps. Small is beautiful.

The standards world is not equipped to invent either applications or even the level below applications. There is too much churn. Where standards can play a role is that where a technology like a platform does establish itself as a market dominator, then competition requirements need to kick in: the standardization  and opening of the technology, with regulator-enforced mandatory RF licensing of any necessary IP (from any party). As a technology like a reaches the status of dominating its market, its economic implication change: the reward for a company having its proprietary technology reach market dominating success should be first-mover rewards, not the rewards of artificial monopoly: secrecy, ownership, control, licensing, strategy etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rather than just exhort the &quot;GenY&#039;ers&quot; to do the right thing, it would be useful to understand where they&#039;re coming from.  Some hypotheses off the top of my head:
- Nobody except big companies selling expensive consulting (or trying to hurt their competitors)  are making much of a living  producing those open source / web apps? The rags-to-riches iPhone app developer might be mostly a fable, but there are more examples than there are rags-to-riches Mozilla contributors.
- The network effect of popular proprietary platforms such as iPhone gets you more happy customers with less effort than &quot;write once debug everywhere&quot; with web standards / javascript?
- It&#039;s easier for moderately skilled developers to write good looking and acceptable performance apps with the proprietary stuff?
- The Internet/Web was architected for an environment of trust, with security grafted on and in an arms race with those who would steal or vandalize, for profit or kicks. Mr. / Ms. GenY&#039;er may prefer to download with confidence from an app store that does some level of screening than risk a phishing or malware attack from some randome website?]]></description>
