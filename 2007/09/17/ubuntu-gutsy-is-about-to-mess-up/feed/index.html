					<description><![CDATA[I run compiz on openSUSE 10.2 without too much trouble, although I only have few window open (a VMware console and Banshee, perhaps a terminal window).  From time to time the colours fade to monochrome when a window isn&#039;t responding, but on my system that usually corresponds to a heavy disk load, it isn&#039;t obvious held up at other times.  I&#039;m running the NVIDIA binary driver.

Cheers, Tony.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi David,

I think its a general problem (I&#039;m using an intel 82945G/GZ integrated graphics card).

I googled the problem a few months back, one suggested solution was to set and environment variable,

AWT_TOOLKIT=”MToolkit”

in /etc/environment

 it did not work for me at the time however I&#039;ve just retried it with success.

					<description><![CDATA[Dave: I didn&#039;t try Java, but I was occasionally getting black windows under compiz as well (I had forgotten about that).  Are you using the closed-source Nvidia driver as well, or is this a more general problem?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, they arent switching over to compiz, this is the second release with compiz. They are just enabling it by default this time.

As far as your problems with open office and xorg......ITS STILL IN PRE-BETA!

They are still a month away from releasing this version, so they still have many more bugs to fix. Mellow out yo. Let the debuggers do what they&#039;re paid for. Sit tight and wait for FINAL
to come out.]]></description>
