					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for spotting that, Keith -- I&#039;m glad that Google has added great circles after all.  Right now, the segment resolution is a bit too coarse (the great circles look pretty chunky), but I&#039;m sure Google will deal with that soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, there is an API to draw great circles.  It was added in v2.84 of the Google Maps API:

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;...which ensures that distances are preserved (any two points the same distance apart on the chart are the same distance apart in the real world)&quot;

I don&#039;t think any projection from a curved surface to a flat plane can preserve distances.  As I understand it, the Lambert conic conformal is just a better approximation to this than most.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the digital age, distortion on the screen isn&#039;t a big deal so long as your users have tools that measure actual distances and areas correctly, but if you really want conformal projections, there are good open source map and cartography engines. FlightAware uses MapServer: http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu. For the browser, you might want to check out the MapBuilder project. They were porting the PROJ.4 library to JavaScript and might be done by now.]]></description>
