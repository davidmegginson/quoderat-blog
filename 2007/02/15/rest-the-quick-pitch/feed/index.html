					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry, but
    http://www.example.org/systems/foo/components/bar/ 
is way less self explaining than

What is http://www.example.org/systems/foo/bar/components/ 
Only the developer knows, what he meant.

I also think the risk of unintentional overwriting should be minimized by authorisation, not by syntax.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post.

I&#039;m glad that you said &quot;_Try_ to avoid request parameters&quot; (empahasis on try), since I see this as an example of where the ideals of REST taken to the extreme would make life a real pain in the ass. I &quot;try&quot; to do this when desining REST protocols, but only up to a certain point. Query strings are a practical convenience and are so broadly supported that to force every URL to be in the form /foo/bar/foo2/bar2/abc/def would just make things a lot harder than they need to be (for both clients and servers).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pete:

Your question &quot;how would you dereference it&quot; was exactly what killed URNs in the end (or at least put them into a permanent coma).  They were a big deal in the late 1990s among the web technorati, who wanted to give us identifiers that were not subject to the whims of DNS (for example, you could give an ISBN-based URN to identify a book, instead of the Amazon link), but nobody ever figured out how they would actually work. Since the XML spec was written at that time, it retains the oddity that a system identifier (such as the external DTD subset) can be a URN reference as well as a URL reference, though I&#039;m not sure what most XML parsers would do if they ever ran across something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&#060;!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM &quot;urn:newsml:megginson.com:20070216:foo-dtd:1&quot;&#062;

&#060;foo&#062;Hello, world!&#060;/foo&#062;
&lt;/pre&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love it!
I hate URNs too.

Content-negotiation may come into its own yet, especially with something like yadis for OpenID, but suffixes are ok, so long as they&#039;re the format being returned, not the authoring tool - i.e. .xml, .json, .html is fine, .php, .pl, .asp, .asmx sucks. Much better than ?format=json as seen in Yahoo! services, anyway.]]></description>
