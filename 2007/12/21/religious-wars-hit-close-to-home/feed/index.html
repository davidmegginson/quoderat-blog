					<description><![CDATA[John:

Sadly, while &lt;cite&gt;Silver Bells&lt;/cite&gt; still represents your experience in NYC and mine in Ottawa (and Toronto, earlier), walking along a downtown street past decorated storefronts is hardly typical of the U.S. or Canadian shopping experience any more.  Even malls &#8212; where you still at least pass other people walking between the Gap and Radio Shack &#8212; are dying out, in favour of big boxes where you drive from parking lot to parking lot (assuming that you&#039;re not ordering online).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Silver Bells is moderately important, though, because it&#039;s an *urban* secular Christmas song, otherwise a rare breed.  With the overwhelming majority of North Americans living in cities, it&#039;s important to have a song or two representing the urban Christmas experience.

Besides, the movie it comes from, The Lemon Drop Kid, is loosely based on a Damon Runyon story, and so the city in question is The City, the Big Apple, one of the most multicultural places on, or rather off, the continent, and my own city to boot.  (Though I certainly admit that Toronto is very much in the big leagues here.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Scott:

Don&#039;t forget that (a) the school choir &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; sing Christian Christmas songs as well, with no lyrics changed (as well as Hanukkah songs), and (b) &lt;cite&gt;Silver Bells&lt;/cite&gt; is a pop song from a 1950s movie soundtrack, not a Christian hymn like &lt;cite&gt;Silent Night&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;cite&gt;Away in a Manger&lt;/cite&gt;.  I also did not see any mention in the news that atheists were involved.

Most of the people I&#039;ve met who are over-sensitive about mentioning Christmas are Christians themselves, not atheists, Jews, Muslims, etc., as I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2006/12/22/its-ok-to-wish-me-merry-christmas/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If there&#039;s a war over Christmas, it&#039;s a civil war within Christianity, not a war between Christianity and other religions or philosophies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I do not support folks making threats of any nature, especially on an issue like this,
I must say that I AM sick and tired of the lack of tolerance FOR Christians and Christianity.
The media and atheists are more than happy to point out the hypocrites who do not practice
what they preach (which is fine, but don&#039;t condemn ALL of Christianity for the fallen few),
and they shout about how intolerant Christians are.

Unfortunately, the Atheists quickly forget
their own hypocrisy and intolerance when they force THEIR view of the world on us. This is a
perfect example of atheism run rampant, when they change words in traditional songs
to try to wipe out any thought of Christ, Christianity or Christmas. There needs to be
tolerance of Christian ideals, just as much as Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, and yes, even Atheism.

Merry Christmas! Peace on Earth and good will toward men.]]></description>
