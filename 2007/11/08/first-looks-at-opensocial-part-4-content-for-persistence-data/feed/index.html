					<description><![CDATA[How about a third idea, that you could &quot;submit&quot; your app to the OpenSocial container and it would run entirely server-side? Then it would obviously need some persistent storage somewhere, and you might as well use a shared protocol... if Google et al are thinking like this, it starts to make more sense.

I agree that the protocol is very bloated, but even this isn&#039;t quite as much of an issue if most of the network chatter is local to the OpenSocial container.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d read someone else talk about how GData is a bastardization (my word) of Atom, but I haven&#039;t ever looked at GData myself.  If this is at all indicative of the rest of GData, I am very disappointed in Google.  They should have created their own XML schemas, or used RDF/XML instead.  Your earlier posts contained some puzzling usage of Atom, but this is just plain obscene.]]></description>
