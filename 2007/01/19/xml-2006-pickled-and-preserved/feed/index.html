					<description><![CDATA[I David, just found your blog and I like it...

I agree that ideally you shouldn&#039;t show {.asp,.jsp,.php} extensions...  Yet many of the planet&#039;s most successful websites (both in terms of availability and users) do use them (well, at least they don&#039;t bother to hide these extensions).

Regarding the security concern, hiding the extension is just &quot;security by obscurity&quot;.  Now I&#039;m certainly not saying the website is *less* secure...  but you&#039;re not gaining much (some would say that with security by obscurity you&#039;re gaining nothing).

Regarding the banks websites:  I know that out of security concern most of the banking industry is using Java and Java backed Webapp servers.  I like that, for I know that there hasn&#039;t been a single buffer overflow targetting any single JVM since Java exist (there have been exploits in thirdparties, C-written, libs, like zlib, though).  So when I&#039;m on a website and I see &quot;.jsp&quot; I tend to think: it&#039;s backed by Java, it&#039;s probably not as insecure as a .asp or .php website.

But that may be just me.

Anyway this is a false argument for only a very small percentage of the population, actually an insignificant one, knows what it means when they see .php or .asp or .jsp etc.

I agree it&#039;s better not show the extensions, but I wouldn&#039;t consider showing them to be such a huge problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Deepak:

Exposing scripting extensions leads to a huge range of problems for web sites:




The extension exposes both the scripting environment being used and the architecture of the site (e.g. get-bank-account.asp?account=12345), providing valuable information to any would-be cracker.



The scripting extension makes long-term maintenance of the site very difficult, since you will have to either break all existing links and bookmarks or add a complicated, high-maintenance set of redirects as the site&#039;s architecture or web framework changes over the years (even something as simple as splitting one script into two or vice-versa could break thousands of external links and bookmarks).



Search engines cannot index pages that rely on POST parameters, and often won&#039;t index pages that rely on GET parameters, so you&#039;re damaging the site&#039;s search-engine placement.



(Less important) scripting extensions look tacky and amateurish, and reflect especially badly on big companies like banks and merchants who rely on online trust (if they don&#039;t know enough to hide the script extensions, do they really know enough to protect my credit card number?).




For a more detailed and thoughtful discussion of this topic, see Tim Berners-Lee&#039;s famous paper, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cool URLs don&#039;t change&lt;/a&gt; &#8212; there are some real-world examples at the end of sites bombing miserably from not following the advice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Ed.  Content negotiation sounded cool back in the 1990s when the Tim B-L and others at the W3C were pushing it so hard, but outside of their own site, I haven&#039;t seen it much (if at all) in the wild.  I wonder if it&#039;s one abstraction too far.

Relying simply on well-known file extensions (html, png, jpg, pdf) for media identification worked very well in this case, with one exception, which I didn&#039;t notice until after I made the posting: I was relying on the web server to send out the right character encoding (I had used .htaccess in Apache), so I&#039;ve had to send a note to IDEAlliance&#039;s ISP asking all files to be served out as UTF-8.  Right now, IIS is sending them simply as &#039;Content-type: text/html&#039; with no encoding specified.  Firefox guesses UTF-8 correctly, but MSIE doesn&#039;t.  That should be fixed early next week.  IIS also sends out stupid caching headers, but I&#039;ve also requested that those be fixed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An issue you don&#039;t mention is preservation of the media type.  A cooler implementation would use &quot;/programme/presentations/123&quot; without the .html extension leaving the choice of media type to content negotiation.  However, that doesn&#039;t work so well when the files are stored in most file systems which do not preserve media type.

I assume that, in practice, you required a reliable mapping between filename/URL extension and media type.]]></description>
