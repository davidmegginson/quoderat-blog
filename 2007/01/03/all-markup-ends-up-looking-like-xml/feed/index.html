Masklinn: you&#039;re right that my examples were not very ceiclmpatod and could have been represented more simply in all three markup syntaxes   see Crockford&#039;s comment earlier, which made the same point as yours.Just to throw a wrench into it, though, you cannot always assume that order doesn&#039;t matter.  For example, try this:Saddam HusseinIf you break this down to a map then try to reconstruct the name, you&#039;ll end up with  Hussein Saddam  instead of  Saddam Hussein .  The solution then, of course, is to add *another* property specifying whether the surname comes first or last.Next, you see a name like this:James Fitzwilliam Godwin IIIA simple ordering property won&#039;t work now.  Instead, for your map, you&#039;ll have to include a surname, pre-surname, and post-surname property.  And then you have the problem of honorifics, which can come before ( Dr. ,  Sir ) or after ( PhD ,  OBE ) the name, or prepositions like  de  in French and Spanish, which go with the surname but drop off for collation, etc.I think most people who work with real, non-trival data have experienced these kinds of problems, even when XML has never entered the equation   notice how relational database schemas in production systems usually end up resembling a ball of tangled string more than the neat diagrams in textbooks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My personal experience with JSON and XML is with RPC calls from the browser to the server. Such calls never happen using simple argument lists, but structures. A responsive web application is not allowed to be chatty, and the best way to achieve this is not to do few complex calls instead of many simple calls. Complex calls rely on complex arguments. Once the data structures you encode become large and complex, both JSON and XML become increasingly hard to use. The only helpful thing in XML is that if you bothered to design a schema (which you won&#039;t, in most cases), you&#039;ll get a much earlier warning from the parser, whereas a bad data structure makes it up into the processing code when using JSON.

Other than that, JSON rocks. As Larry Wall puts it, &quot;easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible&quot;. That&#039;s definitely the case with JSON. With XML, it&#039;s more like &quot;easy things are hard like hell, whereas hard things are next to impossible&quot;. At least for RPC from the browser.

As for the scheme syntax: somebody (I think a speaker on google tech talk I saw on youtube) once said that Javascript is sort of a somewhat crippled Lisp with C syntax. Javascript is indeed a language in which you represent programs using the language&#039;s own data structures, to a large extent - which is why JSON is so natural to Javascript. Which is probably why the scheme and JSON examples look so much alike.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice comparison.

So here&#039;s another challenge (should you choose to accept it ;-) Given &quot;There is no information that can be represented in an XML document that cannot be represented in a JSON document&quot;. Ok, we all know RDF/XML syntax is really ugly. So how would you do RDF in JSON?

(There are a few different systems which use RDF in Lisp, so that&#039;s already covered. There&#039;s also  Turtle RDF syntax which is JSON-like in terms of simplicity, and I&#039;m pretty sure Javascript browsers are available, but an eval() would be so much easier...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to hate XML. Then I discovered XPath.

The funny thing is that XPath conversely is such a &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt; for querying &lt;abbr&gt;XML&lt;/abbr&gt; that now I find myself wishing I had it available for native datastructures. Manually writing code to traverse them is tedious at best. The CPAN has several modules that implement (some subset of) XPath for document types it was not designed for, even one that adds an XPath interface to regular classes so that you can use XPath to walk object hierarchies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;rektide:&lt;/strong&gt; I think you hit on a major problem with XML in the browser &#8212; it&#039;s not XML itself, but the DOM, which is an extremely awkward interface to use.  Part of that is because DOM has to be able to handle mixed content as well as fielded data, but a lot of it is simply the DOM&#039;s design history.  Personally, I always use some kind of a simple helper library with browser-based DOM.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[the thing I like about JSON is that it maps to a object oriented data structure, and the tooling surrounding it is just about serial/deserialization.  in comparison, the DOM data structure used by XML is immensely frustrating to deal with.  multiple text node children hanging off elements, content validation before you can .InnerText, theres just a never ending rigamaroll to do what is ultimately a very very simple task, and i for one do not enjoy writing such verbose kludgtastic code.  the data structures built by xml tooling just suck horrendous ass.

i&#039;m still unsure as to the ultimate feasibility, but projects like jsonml to bridge json and xml seem like they could be vital in the future.  there&#039;s a lot of xml out there already, but at this moment, i can say i would like very much to be able to ignore it for the rest of my days, and consume it as json.]]></description>
