					<description><![CDATA[I wonder which we&#039;ll get first, a port of ZFS or a Solaris-based distribution that &quot;just works&quot; as well as Ubuntu. As soon as suspend/resume works reliably on my laptop, I&#039;ll be all over it.

(Despite the fact that I ran Linux for years on a laptop where suspend/resume didn&#039;t work, now that I&#039;ve had it working for a few years, the prospect of living without it again is just too painful.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ReiserFS achieves its aims, roughly spoken, through tricky data structures that minimise redundancy by leaning heavily on the CPU.

That comprises its strength; but itâ€™s also a huge weakness. Minimal redundancy makes metadata corruption hard to detect and likely to be spectacularly disastrous. The filesystem is designed to be compact and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; fast, but itâ€™s brittle and incurs a heavy CPU tax for the speed you get.

Thatâ€™s the opposite set of tradeoffs than Iâ€™d generally prefer in a filesystem: Iâ€™d like it resilient and easy on the CPU. The perfect choice would be the nigh unbreakable ext2, of course â€“  if only fsck didnâ€™t take forever and 3 days to finish on modern harddisks. So I switched to ext3 partly out of laziness, and partly because at the time, none of the other alternatives to ReiserFS were any good. Iâ€™ve heard quite a few good words about XFS and some about JFS bt now, but Iâ€™m not sure how well theyâ€™re shaken out so Iâ€™m languishing on the safe default. As an aside, I wish there was a good modern filesystem that can be read and written by both Linux and FreeBSDâ€¦]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The problem with reiserfs, however clever it is (and it is clever, and version 5 would have been amazingly so, as unlikely as we are to see it now), is that Hans Reiser thinks it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; filesystem.  (Insert explanation of intrinsic vs. extrinsic possession here.)]]></description>
