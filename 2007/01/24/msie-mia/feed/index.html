					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve checked the FeedBurner stats for my blog for the last 3 days, and those do distinguish IE 6 &#038; 7.  My blog is mostly hit by searches from Google, mostly for Linux-related items.  My stats are
Firefox 2.0.0.1: 35%
IE 6.0: 18%
Firefox 1.5.0.9: 13%
IE 7.0: 11%
Firefox 2.0: 7%
Mozilla 5.0: 6%
Other: 11%
That&#039;s 61% for Firefox+Mozilla, 29% for IE.  IE 6 still has almost twice as much usage as IE7 according to my stats.  As far as operating systems go, to the nearest 1/2 percent it&#039;s
Windows XP: 48.5%
Linux: 41.5%
Windows 2000: 3.5%
Mac OS X (PowerPC): 1.5%
Mac OS X (Intel): 1.5%
Windows 2003: 1.5%
Windows Vista: 1%
Other: 1%
so it&#039;s Windows 54.5%, Linux 41.5%, Mac 3%.
Cheers, Tony.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dave, I&#039;ve seen similar stats since IE 7 was released, and know many people that were die hard IE 6 users that have made to switch to FireFox after having used IE 7.   Our own stats are around 65% IE, 33% Firefox, with over 87% of vistors using a Windows OS.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re seeing about three times the normal percentage of Mac users and probably ten times the normal percentage of Linux users. I wish the rest of the web had stats like that, but, alas, no. At work (a large shopping website), Firefox is still down around 10% or so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If a quarter of your visitors are non-Windows, that is a high percentage indeed (about 95% of desktops run Windows, by the best current guesses).  It&#039;s hardly surprising that MSIE is low.  And I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s IE7 being classified as unknown, or you&#039;d see a big spike in Unknown.]]></description>
