					<description><![CDATA[stand: thanks for the second comment, because it gives me a chance to make up for any overstatement in my posting.

I have no problem with people talking about how things actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; &#8212; we&#039;re in a tough recession, and people are losing jobs, retirement savings, etc.  I&#039;m complaining only about the people who deliberately exaggerate it just to get attention or score political points, and talk about things that the numbers don&#039;t seem to support, like another depression, or the complete collapse of the West, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting, David. So granting your point about fear-mongering (and I do agree with it) how should a responsible person behave if s/he genuinely believes things are bad and wants to warn others? Or is it just a matter of not being self-righteous about it?

I might adopt a fear-mongering strategy presuming that it would be more effective at getting the word out. Perhaps I&#039;ve decided that the risk of making things worse is outweighed by the possibility of getting more people to take the situation seriously. Markets may or may not be 100% unpredictable (not sure myself), but there is no question that they are affected by behavior. Economic indicators are ultimately just a *measure of* behavior.

I might freak out a lot of people with my fear-mongering, but if I can get a larger number of people to settle down it might be a net win.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[stand: that&#039;s a good point, and there&#039;s no way to tell when they&#039;ve bottomed out.  Personally, I&#039;m a random-walk type, so I believe that the markets and the economy are *always* 100% unpredictable: things are just as likely to crash tomorrow whether we&#039;re in a recession or a boom.

That said, I think the fearmongering actually does help force the indicators lower, so those people deserve some of the blame for the situation they&#039;re self-righteously complaining about.]]></description>
