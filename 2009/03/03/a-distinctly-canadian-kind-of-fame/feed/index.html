					<description><![CDATA[Martin: when I&#039;m looking for data for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourairports.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OurAirports&lt;/a&gt;, I sometimes use the non-English Wikipedias, especially de.wikipedia.org (which is very good at organizing that kind of information).

I do have good news, though: Wikipedia has recently unified their user databases, so you can enable your account for all the languages (though you still have a separate user and talk page for each one).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting. From a certain angle, this looks like yet another story about the problems of i18n.

I always felt that it is somewhat weird to have this strong separation between e.g. en.wikipedia.org and de.wikipedia.org (with different user databases etc). But this certainly puts that into a different perspective.]]></description>
