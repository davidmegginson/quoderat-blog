					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Alla.  There are two points to consider:

1. That disclaimer wasn&#039;t there when I made the original posting.

2. Review the e-mail that I quote in the posting.  Whether the site designer was phishing or not, the author of the e-mail definitely was.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Google ohare , you will run across other o-hare airport websites that are &quot;unofficial&quot;, like this one: http://www.chicago-ord.com/, which the city of Chicago site also doesn&#039;t mention (why would they,if they want people to go to their site?)

Also, if you look at the bottom of the main page, you will see the following message &quot;This website is a privately owned independent guide to Chicago O&#039;Hare International Airport designed to provide accurate and comprehensive information for the travelers. We are in no way associated with or authorized by the Chicago Airport System and neither that entity nor any of its affiliates have licensed or endorsed us.&quot;


Moreover, i know the people that put the site together, it&#039;s not a phishing site.]]></description>
