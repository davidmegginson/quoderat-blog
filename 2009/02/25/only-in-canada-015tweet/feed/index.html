					<description><![CDATA[Ana: on Rogers, sending an update is exactly like sending any other text message; same on Bell, now that they&#039;ve backed down.  You still can&#039;t *receive* updates on Rogers, though (not sure why, since it&#039;s no problem receiving Facebook updates on Rogers).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree very strongly, Brad, but where can people go?  The problem is lack of competition.  Right now, you can&#039;t receive tweets on Rogers phones at all (although you can send them without a &quot;premium&quot; charge).  As far as I know, Rogers runs the only GSM network in Canada, and every other GSM provider leases it from them; ditto for Bell/Telus and CDMA.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a load of horse-pucky!  There&#039;s no reason why Twitter (or any other SMS service) should be treated as a &quot;premium service&quot;.  Bell needs to get their heads out of their asses, or they&#039;ll find more and more people are going to defect to other service providers.]]></description>
