					<description><![CDATA[Sorry, but anyone who gets the idea to use any technical means to flower up his presentation, but does not know how to employ such technical means, is in my opinion not worth listening to.

And for the rest: if you can think for yourself, please do so. If you cannot, don&#039;t come around asking us to do the thinking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got two time-related tips:

- Don&#039;t talk about talking about your talk. Telling the audience that you&#039;re going to cover the last few slides really quickly doesn&#039;t make them go more quickly; it makes them go more slowly because your wishful thinking out loud just extended the time it took to cover your remaining material.

- No matter how many important things you have to say, if you go over the allotted time, the audience&#039;s mind will switch off when your time is up and they won&#039;t hear what you have to say anyway. Show them the courtesy of timing your talk beforehand and trimming it down so that it really does fit in the allotted time. If you&#039;re giving the last talk before lunch and you go over time, the audience will really, really resent you. They&#039;ll wind up at the end of the buffet line as they watch their friends eat at tables all around them, just because you had to read every single bullet point about the new version&#039;s greater ease of use.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A good set of hints for people to follow. I have a couple more from from my experiences as chair...
1) double-check what time your talk is meant to start
2) show up in enough time before the session starts that you can make sure your laptop plugs into the presentation system and shows whatever you&#039;re planning on showing (note if you&#039;re second in the session, that means show up before the first speaker starts speaking!)
3) remember that people are in the room because they want to hear your talk, so speak loudly enough and slowly enough that they can hear each word

These things make a big difference.]]></description>
