					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re absolutely right, Jim.  In Canada, we&#039;ve been used to being able to visit the U.S. using only driver&#039;s license and birth certificate as ID, but starting in January, we&#039;ll have to show a passport at the border.  Most Canadians who travel already have passports, but it will be a big problem for Americans who want to visit Canada, since they&#039;ll need passports to get back into their own country, and most Americans &lt;em&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/em&gt; have them &#8212; I think it&#039;s going to hurt Canadian conferences quite a bit.

I flew myself down from Ottawa to Boston in a small plane, so at least I didn&#039;t have to go through the airport security silliness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Traveling is great: new places, new people, new traditions. But nowadays it is getting difficult to travel because of the safety measures. Everyone needs to pass a clearance check before getting visa. I’ve heard that the British Embassy requires fingerprints scanned before issuing visas ( http://www.huliq.com/288/printed-for-travel-uk-introduces-finger-scan-for-visa-applicants ). This is good for the security, but I bet this will make difficulties for travelers.]]></description>
