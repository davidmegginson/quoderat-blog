					<description><![CDATA[I think Ottawa is fairly safe from the mega-tsunami.  When it happens (say in the next 200 years), worst case should be that it destroys a 30km (20 mile) deep stretch of the east coast of North America (not sure about South America).  On the other hand, people who live on Manhattan Island shouldn&#039;t count on having enough time to out of the 30km destruction zone (there will be about 5 hours warning as I remember; I don&#039;t know how much of Manhattan you could evacuate in that time).

I&#039;m still more worried about being run over by traffic than I am about any natural disasters, though.  Perhaps Ottawa could just dump its jaywalking laws, and live on the edge like the UK does.

Cheers, Tony.]]></description>
