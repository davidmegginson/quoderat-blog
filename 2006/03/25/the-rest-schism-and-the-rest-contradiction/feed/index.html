					<description><![CDATA[I stay out of the REST is better then WS-* argument, because I don&#039;t have any firm numbers to state which is better.  I personally prefer REST.

My problem was that defining REST in terms of HTTP verbs is missing the whole point of rest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If someone came out with a plain way to describe how to create a &quot;restful API&quot; and gave it a name (a la &quot;Ajax&quot;), people would switch to it in a second. The problem is that REST&#039;s current primary documentation is a doctoral dissertation that is mostly unintelligible to a normal human being.

Secondly, REST backers need to come to a conclusion on whether ot not PUT is necessary (no one ever DELETEs).

Finally, once there is some common understanding of (the son of) REST, we should document how some popular APIs would look (e.g., Amazon, Flickr, Bloglines, etc.).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s important to note that what&#039;s demonstrated to work is indeed GET and POST, but *GET and POST as defined*.  I suspect that when Don says &quot;POST&quot; he&#039;s implicitly encompassing both tunneled and non-tunneled uses of POST.

Also, GET and POST used as defined is RESTful, and nothing in REST says that you have to use all methods.  It only says you have to use the right one for the job (per self-description).  If you only need to get data, or submit it for processing, then only using GET and POST is just fine.]]></description>
