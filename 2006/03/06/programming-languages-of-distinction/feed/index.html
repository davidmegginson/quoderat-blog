					<description><![CDATA[[...] So in my answer to Scott’s question, I think it may well be that many developers completely leave. But I imagine that many others will take the path that Rob Conery, the creator of Subsonic wrote about. He’s choosing to help try and change the developer culture around Microsoft from the inside, rather than jumping ship completely. Like a good ALT.NET developer, he sees some value in the Microsoft platform and tries to combine what is good from it, along with what is good from other platforms, rather than just giving in to the self-perpetuating cycle of successful programming languages.

					<description><![CDATA[Kai:
Maybe the case is that the original founders (elite programmers) are so heavily invested in their language, that they rarely move on. It&#039;s rather the sub-elite, who have been promoted to elite. They are stuck at the second-highest rank of the social ladder - as henchmen of the founding fathers. One way to rise beyond this is to move on and settle on a new language, where they themselves can become founders. The founders themselves OTOH have nothing to gaim from the exile - they are already at the peak.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kartik:

I agree that Ruby has some neat tricks (syntactic and otherwise), but when you look at development speed, bug reduction, etc., it&#039;s hard to argue that any of them gives Ruby as big an advantage over Java or Python as the advantage that all scripting/VM languages have over manual-memory-management languages like C/C++.  Closures? I remember being excited about them ten years ago when I was coding a lot in Scheme (another great programming language), but in the end, they didn&#039;t make much of a difference in how I worked. Automatic introspection? I&#039;m a touch typist, so saving 30 seconds of typing here or there isn&#039;t significant.

I may come over to Ruby some day (it definitely has the most fun tutorials), but it&#039;s also possible that before then some other language will find another low-hanging fruit like memory management that blasts Ruby, Java, Python, and everyone else right out of the water, the way that Java has blasted C/C++ for enterprise development.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got to agree with Nordsieck: I don&#039;t think truly elite developers really give a damn whether other people are using their language of choice or not. &quot;Oh no, my Favorite Thing is getting popular, so now I have to repudiate it and pick something else to be my favorite&quot; is not the behavior of wizard-level programmers; in my experience, it&#039;s the behavior of latte-slurping trendoids who care more about other people&#039;s opinions than their own taste.

Now that Perl is huge (indeed, many would say *too* huge, and past its prime), does Larry Wall move on to something new? No, he&#039;s still working on Perl. Of course, he wrote the language, but the same goes for Tom Christiansen and Damian Conway.

I&#039;m sure the same thing could also be said in the Python world. Now that Python is gaining popularity, are the serious wizard-level Python programmers saying &quot;Oh, dear, it seems the proles have arrived. How teddibly gauche they are. I must go and become a Boo guru now, just to avoid these tedious plebeians&quot;? Somehow, I don&#039;t think so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Elite (guru) developers notice too many riff-raff using their current programming language, and start looking for something that will distinguish them better from their mediocre colleagues.&quot;

This assumes that &quot;Elite developers&quot; actually care about what the masses use to program with.  My guess is that most of them just want to use a (the most) productive language (one in which the development/testing/integration of a certain feature takes the least amount of time, balanced with the highest level of physical performance).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What you want is a measure of the degree to which skill in a programming language has become commoditized. For instance, take a job website like http://www.jobserve.com/

Search for commoditized skills like Java, SQL, C++ and you find x,000 jobs advertised. Ideally of course you&#039;d have a longitudinal view on this; you&#039;d have data on the number of jobs offering requiring this and that skill across time and understand the rise and ebb of particular skills.

Search for niche skills like Python and you find (today) 200 jobs advertised.

Search for Ruby and right now you find 22 jobs on www.jobserve.com.

Search for Groovy and you find one actual job. That&#039;s where you want to be; learning a language so esoteric that one day you can be the guru, or at least one of his henchmen. But maybe, maybe the fact that there&#039;s already one job posted means you&#039;re just too late...

To be honest, I saw this idea expressed lucidly in Chad Fowler&#039;s book, available from http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/]]></description>
