					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments, John, David, and Lars.

John: That&#039;s the clearest argument I&#039;ve ever seen in favour of frameworks: to elaborate, frameworks are a bit like project managers -- unpleasant, but sometimes necessary once you have a certain number of people working on the same code. A large application is always going to need some kind of well-defined top-level architecture to allow people to work together, so the real question is whether an off-the-shelf framework will make a good fit or the top-level architecture should be customized for each application.  Unfortunately, the large projects that I&#039;ve seen that used frameworks like Struts or Spring have tended not to use them consistently, as if the framework were something that the developers had to work around.

David: I don&#039;t know if this is universally accepted, but my definition of a framework is something that takes over much or all of the top-level control flow of your application -- in other words, instead of your application serving as the glue that holds the library components together, a framework serves as the glue that holds your application components together.  High-level library functions don&#039;t constitute a framework, because you still call them when and where you want.

Lars: Swing is an interesting borderline case, as is SAX -- since they use callbacks, does that make them frameworks?  Since I can use Swing components individually in several different kinds of application architecture, I might exclude Swing; SAX *has* to use callbacks, though, so it really does constitute a parsing framework, though not a full application framework.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to say I sympathize with your point of view, but I&#039;m not sure this is really black-and-white. To take some randomly chosen examples I find the framework approach taken by Axis (Java SOAP implementation) to be tiresome for exactly the reasons you give. I&#039;d be much happier did not take the framework attitude (don&#039;t call us, we&#039;ll call you), but instead left me with more control.

On the other hand, when it comes to frameworks like Swing I really prefer the framework approach. There&#039;s just too much to worry about, and I&#039;d rather someone else took care of it, even if it does force me to work their way. The same goes for the operating system, I guess. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Frameworks are necessary for what is called software engineering, which Dijkstra sardonically defined as &quot;How to program if you cannot.&quot;  You need them when you are working on a project too large to hold in any one hacker&#039;s head.  They suck, but churning out tens of thousands of lines of almost-repetitive code to handle the weird and idiosyncratic little details that every customer demands be done differently or else can&#039;t reasonably be done any other way.]]></description>
