					<description><![CDATA[Sound quality on Skype seems to be very much a function of the microphones/speakers in use.  With reasonable headsets it&#039;s as good as any phone except for the very slight time-lag, with builtin laptop microphones it&#039;s awful.  My use has been mostly within Europe (UK, Sweden, Switzerland) plus a few calls to Egypt or Hong Kong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve also found that Skype usually had average quality to the best (I tried to use on Linux, oh the interface works fine but not the audio which makes it pointless).

I gave a try to other products and I&#039;ve found Gizmo to be the most reliable. I also love the audio quality delivered by GTalk (not mentionning its non bloated interface) but Gizmo has the advantage to work find under Linux as well.

There is also OpenWengo which seems to do fine (I haven&#039;t tested it much though) and which is open source.

You might want to give those an ear :)]]></description>
