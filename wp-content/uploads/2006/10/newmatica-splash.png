<h1>Blogs temporarily down for repair</h1>

<p>The <cite>Quoderat</cite> and <cite>Land and Hold Short</cite>
blogs are temporarily down for repair.  Please accept my apologies for
any inconvenience.</p>

<p>Someone was trying to attack my database through WordPress,
resulting in loss of service for several web sites as my server slowed
down with load factors sometimes over 100.</p>

<p>The blogs should be back online within a few days (or weeks), once
I've sorted out the problem, cleaned the database tables, and applied
security upgrades.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you're an aviation fan, why not pop
by <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a>?</p>
