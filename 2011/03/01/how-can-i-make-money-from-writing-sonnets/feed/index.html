Well, I don&#039;t take them too seriously in a psychological sense, but true approval comes not only from self-approval, but from peer repute.]]></description>

Good point, John &#8212; thanks for the feedback, and apologies for any offense.  Employment &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a carefully-designed, highly artificial system, but so is representational democracy, so that&#039;s not automatically a bad thing.

I respect that not everyone will agree, but I believe it&#039;s better not to take any employer&#039;s praise, promotion, or financial incentives seriously &#8212; it&#039;s far better to take pride in your work exclusively because &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; know it&#039;s good.  When that happens, you own your job, no matter who is signing the paycheques.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this message is rather offensive to those of us who work for someone else for a living, though admittedly it isn&#039;t addressed to us.  But for the record, I do indeed expect and get praise, retention, bonuses, merit raises, and/or promotion when I do something good, and the opposite things if I do something bad.  I don&#039;t think you ought to call the way most people still live their lives an artificial sandbox; it trivializes the effort made and the very real and valuable work that gets done.]]></description>
