										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m looking for February or March numbers, but according to <a href="http://www.housepriceindex.ca/Default.aspx">Teranet and the National Bank of Canada</a>, as of January 2009, house prices across Canada had dropped only 2.35% since January 2008 (that&#8217;s using CHPI, which is the more negative of the two major indices).  Here&#8217;s a breakdown by major cities:</p>
<table>
<col width="10em"></col>
<col align="center" width="5em"></col>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> City<br />
(West to east)</th>
<th> CHPI change<br />
(Jan 08-Jan 09)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Vancouver</td>
<td style="background:#FF3333;">-4.16%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Calgary</td>
<td style="background:#FF2222;">-8.2%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Toronto</td>
<td style="background:#FF4444;">-2.44%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ottawa</td>
<td style="background:#33FF33;">+2.11%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Montreal</td>
<td style="background:#44FF44;">+4.11%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Halifax</td>
<td style="background:#22FF22;">+1.24%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Why the disparity?  Calgary is an oil city.  When the recession hit and resource prices tanked, Calgary was the centre of a huge housing bubble because of high oil prices, and Vancouver was in a major real-estate bubble of its own because of the upcoming 2010 Winter Olympics, so both had further to fall — they&#8217;re just adjusting back to realistic market prices.</p>
<p>Toronto is the financial centre of Canada, and we all know what happened to the finance industry, but it has a very wide employment base outside of finance, and vibrant immigrant community, and a lot of pent-up housing demand, so I&#8217;m not surprised to see a more moderate fall there.</p>
<p>Ottawa is the capital, so it has government jobs as a cushion, but it&#8217;s also one of Canada&#8217;s leading tech centres.  While big companies like Nortel and Corel are in terminal decline, small tech companies around Ottawa are doing very well.  I live here, and as far as I can tell, for-sale signs on lawns still don&#8217;t stay up too long.</p>
<p>Montreal.  Montreal?  It was the awkward poor sibling of big Canadian cities for a couple decades after the whole separatism thing started (and people and head offices fled to Ottawa and Toronto), but it&#8217;s been coming back recently — the streets aren&#8217;t as dirty, the heroin addicts are panhandling more politely, and after all, it&#8217;s still Montreal.  Just like Manhattan in the 1970s at its dirtiest and most dysfunctional was still more fun than any other U.S. city, Montreal will always be the coolest Canadian city to visit.  The suburban (and English-speaking) west end of the island is a huge centre for pharmaceutical companies, and perhaps they&#8217;re doing well in the recession (I haven&#8217;t checked).</p>
<p>Not much to say about Halifax, which is a much smaller city than the others, except that it&#8217;s a nice place, and I&#8217;m glad to see they&#8217;re doing well.</p>
<p>Perhaps when I find February or March figures, the news will be worse; then again, as a measurement tool, <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/109971-the-problem-with-housing-stats">CHPI can make things look a lot worse than RSPI</a>, so it&#8217;s just as likely that things are better than these number suggest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought it would be interesting to run a simple test for Canada — take some key economic indicators, and see how far we&#8217;ve slipped.  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve tracked down so far:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5pt">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Indicator</th>
<th>Date</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Last seen<br />
(before October 2008)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>GDP</th>
<td>Q4 2008</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Basically, we&#8217;ve slipped back to between 2004 and 2007, depending on which indicator you look at (a little further, probably, if I included stock market indices).  That&#8217;s not great (and our population is a bit larger), but ask yourself this: how did you feel in 2004?  Were you as worried as you are now?  Did it feel like a depression then?</p>
<p>I know things aren&#8217;t great — especially for people who&#8217;ve been laid off and/or lost their retirement savings or homes — but I think the (mainly left-wing) pundits (journalists, bloggers, and politicians) who keep screaming words like &#8220;depression&#8221; are just exploiting fear to try to get more attention for themselves, just like the (mainly right-wing) pundits did with anti-terrorism fears after 2001-09-11.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a vicious circle, because they have to keep upping the ante to stand out from the others, until we&#8217;re all convinced we&#8217;ll be standing in soup lines tomorrow (assuming anyone can afford to supply us with soup).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a></strong> lets members tag airports to create different kinds of maps.  I&#8217;ve created two maps that show very vividly where the intersections of people, money, and land occur in the world.</p>
<h2>Welcome to the club &#8230;</h2>
<p>The first tag, <strong><var><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/top150/">top150</a></var></strong>, shows the world&#8217;s 150 busiest airports by passenger traffic (as of 2007).  Central Africa has lots of people, but not much money, so it&#8217;s empty.  Australia and Canada have high per-capita incomes but a low population density, so they also appear mostly empty in the map, with only a handful of top-150 airports each.  The U.S. has a lot of land but also a lot of money and a lot of people, so it&#8217;s very full.  India and the Persian Gulf countries are starting to fill up, as incomes rise and more people travel.</p>
<h2>&#8230; but not <em>this</em> club</h2>
<p>The second tag, <strong><var><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/top30/">top30</a></var></strong>, shows a much more exclusive club, the world&#8217;s 30 busiest airports by passenger traffic.  These are the absolute busiest hubs, and it takes a rich <em>and</em> populous city or country to support one.  Not by accident, fully half of these airports (15) are in the United States, and 8 more are in Western Europe, leaving only 7 for the rest of the world to share.</p>
<p>In this club, the 1.3 billion citizens of China are represented by only two airports (including Hong Kong), and the 1.2 billion citizens of India are not represented at all.  Canada and Australia also don&#8217;t make the cut (too few people).</p>
<p>Of course, there are other considerations: aside from its money, land, and people, the heavy air passenger traffic in the U.S. may also reflect its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak">horrendous rail system</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em><strong>Summary:</strong> Perhaps the women who don&#8217;t choose computer programming are making a good choice, especially with the deteriorating working conditions, stagnant or falling salaries, and offshoring.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, we&#8217;ve had a few postings about women in computing (or the lack thereof) — see <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/14/DevChix">Bray</a>, <a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/archives/2007/06/14/tech-women/">Wood</a>, <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/30">Tenison</a>, and <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/20/Women">Bray (again)</a>, all ignited by a <a href="http://www.devchix.com/2007/06/09/let%e2%80%99s-all-evolve-past-this-the-barriers-women-face-in-tech-communities/">piece in devChix</a>.</p>
<p>These postings all assume that we need to <em>do something</em> to pull more women into coding.  Why?  Do we think there are there lots of women would be happy coding, but aren&#8217;t smart enough or motivated enough to choose the right careers for themselves, or are too timid to deal with any barriers unless someone comes along and dismantles them first?</p>
<div id="market">
<h3>Listen to the market</h3>
<p>In an age where we&#8217;ve come to trust central planning less and the free market more, why not try to learn from the labour market instead of trying to push it ways it doesn&#8217;t want to go?</p>
<p>If we assume that the majority of working women <em>are</em> smart, strong, motivated, and brave, then we can also assume that they have good reasons for choosing their careers.  And in fact, it turns out that their track record isn&#8217;t bad.  For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, women were grossly underrepresented in manufacturing and overrepresented in lower-paying service-industry jobs like retail.  But when manufacturing starting offshoring in the 1980s and 1990s, it was the women who were still working (often as managers, at this point), while the men were at home, depressed, collecting welfare cheques or trying to retrain for jobs that paid a fraction of what they used to earn.</p>
<p>Now, while there&#8217;s lots of work connected with tech, we see pure coding increasingly being offshored, the same way that manufacturing was 20 years ago.  There&#8217;s no shortage of women working in jobs connected with computers, but instead of coding, many women choose onsite consulting, training, marketing, and other jobs that are not only social but require face time with customers, and as a result, are much more difficult to offshore.</p>
<p>Of course, if you absolutely love coding, like I do (and most of the people reading this do), you&#8217;re going to work hard to try to find a way to keep doing it, whether you&#8217;re a man or a woman.  But if you don&#8217;t feel that burning love, why let yourself be dragged kicking and screaming into an industry where salaries are falling, jobs are fleeing, hours are increasing (bye bye weekends!), and workers are increasingly treated as interchangeable cogs on a development assembly line, without even the (questionable) union protection their parents had in their factory jobs 20-30 years ago?</p>
