When might a company decide that web usability is a bad thing?</p>
<p>If I were a conspiracy theorist, I&#8217;d suggest that companies deliberately sabotage forms for tasks like refund requests, to discourage user conversion.  Practically speaking, however, I think it&#8217;s more a matter of just not bothering to invest in them past the alpha stage.  Consider FedEx Canada&#8217;s refund form:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fedex.com/ca_english/services/moneyback-claimform.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.fedex.com/ca_english/services/moneyback-claimform.html</a></p>
<p>Every field on this form is required, even though many of them won&#8217;t apply (e.g. you might not have your own invoice number associated with the shipment, and you almost certainly won&#8217;t have a fax number), and some are actually contradictory (you will have <i>either</i> a FedEx Express Air waybill number <i>or</i> a FedEx Ground Tracking ID, but not both).</p>
<p>On a higher level, nothing in the form makes it clear whether you&#8217;re filling in your address or the address to which you were sending the package. Flip a coin!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the form also doesn&#8217;t bother with data-type validation, so I was able to put &#8220;n/a&#8221; in all the fields that didn&#8217;t apply (1995 called and took away my fax machine), and I was able to guess that they wanted my address, based on the presence of a picklist for Canadian provinces.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an enterprising soul, you might consider setting up shop as a Web Unusability consultant, to help companies find ways to keep customers from filling out unwelcome forms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Remember when we thought the web was stuck in a rut, with IE, Flash preroll, fixed-width layouts, and endless browser incompatibilities? <a href="https://quoderat.megginson.com/2014/08/23/its-never-the-end-of-history/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Link: </strong><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/">http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/</a></p>
<p>Ten years ago, circa 2004, it felt like the web had found its rut and would never get out: XML and XHTML had failed to fix the browser-incompatibility mess, the horrid Internet Explorer had achieved almost total browser-market dominance, and web designers were focussing on animated pre-rolls and big screens. Even in 2009, when the rise of mobile was impossible to ignore, Ethan Marcotte still sounded like an Isaiah shouting from the wilderness when he pleaded with us to think differently:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of exploring the benefits of flexible web design, we rely on a little white lie: “minimum screen resolution.” These three words contain a powerful magic, under the cover of which we churn out fixed-width layout after fixed-width layout, perhaps revisiting a design every few years to “bump up” the width once it’s judged safe enough to do so. “Minimum screen resolution” lets us design for a contrived subset of users who see our design as god and Photoshop intended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that we weren&#8217;t at the end of web history, but just finishing the first act. After a decade-long intermission of stagnation, things started changing even faster than they had in the optimistic early days of the mid 1990s. IE has become so irrelevant that it&#8217;s barely necessary to test against it any more (unless your audience is big industry or government office workers using obsolescent desktop computers), HTML5 and CSS3 have exploded, the Javascript ecosystem has matured, the majority of page views happen on small-screen mobile devices, and those devices ensure that most users always have the latest version of their browsers (a vain hope in 2004 or 2009).</p>
<p>Five years after Marcotte&#8217;s article, any so-called web designer proposing to work with a fixed &#8220;minimum screen resolution&#8221; would &#8230; and <strong>should</strong> &#8230; be fired. </p>
<p>Except maybe in government and big industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one would mistake me for a graphic designer &mdash; I believe that no merely visual design can match the breathtaking beauty of a properly-normalized database schema &mdash; but still, I recently found myself helping someone design a simple theme for a Drupal web site.  </p>
<p>The site owner was visually-focussed (poor woman, stuck with me as designer!), and had very specific ideas about where layout items and whitespace should go, so I decided that while I have issues with fixed-width layouts like the [in]famous <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid</a>, I shouldn&#8217;t make her suffer for my beliefs: I designed a fixed-width, em-based layout for her.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, she got in touch and said &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry, but &#8230;&#8221;.  She had been looking at the web site on a laptop up to that point, but the first time she opened it on her big monitor at work, it looked like garbage, a tiny strip surrounded by huge bands of whitespace.</p>
<h2>Window size: an obsolete problem?</h2>
<p>I mention this story because I just read a <a href="http://www.gantry-framework.org/documentation/joomla/advanced/960-grid-system">web page</a> that suggests that <em>fluid</em> layouts &mdash; web-page layouts that adjust themselves to fit the width of the browser window &mdash; are passé:</p>
<blockquote><p>
With the advancement in displays and the cheap prices of large 22&#8243; and 24&#8243; displays fluid layouts have quickly become more a hinderance than a help because you don&#8217;t run your browser full screen anymore. You generally run your browser alongside your mail client, your IM client, iTunes, etc. You find a common size for your browser that accommodates most sites, and you leave it at that width.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, apparently not.  At least, not in this case.  The argument seems to be that users will conform to the needs of designers, by carefully resizing their browser windows to make the designs look good, but the web site owner I&#8217;m working with wasn&#8217;t one of those people, and I suspect that not all her visitors will be, either.</p>
<h2>Rogues&#8217; gallery</h2>
<p>The designer of the web site proclaiming the demise of fluid layout probably hoped his or her site would look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png"><img data-attachment-id="426" data-permalink="https://quoderat.megginson.com/2011/02/09/is-fluid-layout-old-fashioned/fixed-normal/" data-orig-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png" data-orig-size="1265,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Fixed-width layout in an ideally-sized browser window." data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=640" src="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=640&#038;h=313" alt="" title="Fixed-width layout in an ideally-sized browser window." width="640" height="313" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-426" srcset="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=640&amp;h=313 640w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=150&amp;h=74 150w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=300&amp;h=147 300w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=768&amp;h=376 768w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=1024&amp;h=502 1024w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>This is what you&#8217;d see on a typical laptop screen, or on a window sized smaller on a big screen.  It&#8217;s beautiful &mdash; I freely admit that I could never design such a nice-looking web site.  </p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s how the same site would look in a large browser window on a large monitor:</p>
<p><a href="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png"><img data-attachment-id="427" data-permalink="https://quoderat.megginson.com/2011/02/09/is-fluid-layout-old-fashioned/fixed-big/" data-orig-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png" data-orig-size="1265,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Fixed-width layout in a very large browser window." data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=640" src="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=640&#038;h=313" alt="" title="Fixed-width layout in a very large browser window." width="640" height="313" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-427" srcset="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=640&amp;h=313 640w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=150&amp;h=74 150w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=300&amp;h=147 300w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=768&amp;h=376 768w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=1024&amp;h=502 1024w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>OK, even I (and probably my guinea pig) can design something nicer-looking than that.  Damn those uncooperative users!  Why do they forget to size their browser windows properly?</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s go down-market, and see how the same site might look in a browser window on a tiny netbook (where the user doesn&#8217;t have the option of choosing a bigger window size):</p>
<p><a href="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="428" data-permalink="https://quoderat.megginson.com/2011/02/09/is-fluid-layout-old-fashioned/fixed-small/" data-orig-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png" data-orig-size="1265,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Fixed-width layout in a very small browser window." data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=640" src="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=640&#038;h=313" alt="" title="Fixed-width layout in a very small browser window." width="640" height="313" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-428" srcset="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=640&amp;h=313 640w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=150&amp;h=74 150w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=300&amp;h=147 300w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=768&amp;h=376 768w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=1024&amp;h=502 1024w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Not nearly as bad as the big screen, but awkward &mdash; I can sort-of see what the designer was trying to do, but I have to scroll around to get the whole effect: it&#8217;s like looking at the Mona Lisa in 5 cm² segments.</p>
<h2>Fluid vs fixed-width is a trade-off</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to conclude by saying &#8220;fixed-width bad, fluid layout good&#8221;, or any such oversimplification, but instead, to suggest that the tradeoff that existed between the two ten years ago still exists today:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want a web site that&#8217;s a respectable <strong>B-</strong> in a wide range of screen sizes, use a fluid layout (it&#8217;s not an accident that that&#8217;s what popular sites like Google use).</li>
<li>If you want a web site that&#8217;s a spectacular <strong>A+</strong> in one screen size, and a dismal <strong>D-</strong> in all others, use a fixed-width layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to demonstrate that you are capable of stunning visual beauty, if you know that most of your users will be viewing the site on a certain type of device, or if you just want to stoke your ego by winning design awards (and you know the resolution the selection jury will be using to view sites), then fixed-width can be a great choice.  For me, however, usability trumps style, so I&#8217;ll stick with fluid-width when I can.</p>
<p>And yes, for the record, you&#8217;re reading this blog (as of 2011-02-09) in a fixed-width layout.  I just use the default theme on wordpress.com with a custom picture in the banner, because I&#8217;m not really all that visually-focussed.  Maybe some day I&#8217;ll get around to seeing if I choose a WordPress theme with a fluid layout here, too.</p>
