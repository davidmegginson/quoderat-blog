When might a company decide that web usability is a bad thing?</p>
<p>If I were a conspiracy theorist, I&#8217;d suggest that companies deliberately sabotage forms for tasks like refund requests, to discourage user conversion.  Practically speaking, however, I think it&#8217;s more a matter of just not bothering to invest in them past the alpha stage.  Consider FedEx Canada&#8217;s refund form:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fedex.com/ca_english/services/moneyback-claimform.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.fedex.com/ca_english/services/moneyback-claimform.html</a></p>
<p>Every field on this form is required, even though many of them won&#8217;t apply (e.g. you might not have your own invoice number associated with the shipment, and you almost certainly won&#8217;t have a fax number), and some are actually contradictory (you will have <i>either</i> a FedEx Express Air waybill number <i>or</i> a FedEx Ground Tracking ID, but not both).</p>
<p>On a higher level, nothing in the form makes it clear whether you&#8217;re filling in your address or the address to which you were sending the package. Flip a coin!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the form also doesn&#8217;t bother with data-type validation, so I was able to put &#8220;n/a&#8221; in all the fields that didn&#8217;t apply (1995 called and took away my fax machine), and I was able to guess that they wanted my address, based on the presence of a picklist for Canadian provinces.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an enterprising soul, you might consider setting up shop as a Web Unusability consultant, to help companies find ways to keep customers from filling out unwelcome forms.</p>

Now I&#8217;d like to get paid for it so that I can quit my job and live off the revenue.  Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ve asked this question yourself: just substitute &#8220;iPhone app&#8221;, &#8220;blog&#8221;, &#8220;web site&#8221;, &#8220;Twitter mashup&#8221;, etc. for &#8220;sonnet&#8221;. You have a right to be proud that your app/blog/site is wonderful, but why won&#8217;t anyone pay you for it?</p>
<h2 id="systems">A pat on the head for young Billy</h2>
<p>In school, when you did good work, you got rewarded, because school is a system designed to encourage you to do your best (at least, a good school is).  In a job, when you do good work, you may get noticed and rewarded, depending on how much value your manager puts on continuing to treat you like a school student.</p>
<p>Outside of these artificially-constructed systems, however, nobody beyond friends and family gives a shit that you did something good &mdash; as Don Draper said on <cite>Mad Men</cite> &#8220;There is no system.  The universe is indifferent.&#8221;  </p>
<h2 id="rewards">Don&#8217;t go past the fence!</h2>
<p>Still, many brave or foolish people venture outside the school/employment sandbox every year, and the moment they go out the gate, they are hit with two shocks at once:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nobody wants to give them money.</li>
<li>Nobody wants to give them praise.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to have a chance of success, you recover from this shock, forget about chasing after praise (it&#8217;s mostly worthless), grit your teeth, and learn through trial and error how to provide enough value to other people that they&#8217;re willing to give you money in exchange.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s hard work &mdash; <em>very</em> hard work &mdash; and the heart of it is not simply promoting a product or service, but spending months and years developing real business relationships with people, and even more importantly, learning (and caring about) what those people &mdash; <em>not</em> you &mdash; want and need.</p>
<h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Many people aren&#8217;t ready to face that kind of a shock, though, and at that point, they&#8217;re an easy mark for anything that promises an alternative to the hard (but necessary) work of actually dealing with people and caring about what they want.  Every year, there seems to be at least one fad that promises a shortcut:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can run Google ads (or others) on your blog or web site, and Google will take care of finding and billing the customers, then will send you a monthly cheque.</li>
<li>You can write a Twitter mashup or Facebook app, where Twitter or Facebook members will take care of the hard work of marketing for you, and you can then get enough visitors to cash in on those adds (or sell subscriptions through PayPal, etc.).</li>
<li>You can post a video to YouTube, and get a share of ad revenue if it goes viral (insert buzzwords like &#8220;social media&#8221; where appropriate).</li>
<li>You can write an iPhone or Android mobile app, and Apple or Google will find and bill your customers for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these promise money (however little they actually deliver), but more importantly, they promise that you can stay in a safe, non-Don-Draper-esque world like the one you remember from school or work: the world where you can get an A+ for doing a <em>very good job</em> on your essay, or a bonus for working <em>extra hard</em> on the ACME account.  Effectively, Google, Apple, or some other organization becomes your teacher/parent/boss, dishing out rewards in the form of money and/or pageviews.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s a world most people understand; it&#8217;s a system where most people feel safe; but it&#8217;s no way to sell a sonnet.</p>
<h2 id="sell">Shakespeare</h2>
<p>To be honest, we don&#8217;t know if Shakespeare ever made money from his sonnets, but he did make a living from his plays &#8230; well, not so much from his plays, as from putting them on.  It turns out that around the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th century, Londoners sometimes wanted to get out of the house and <em>do</em> something, but you can go to only so many bear-baitings and Morris dances before a certain <em>ennui</em> sets in.</p>
<p>Shakespeare didn&#8217;t just sit in a lonely garret writing plays to for someone else to put on (the 1600 equivalent of writing mobile apps for the iTunes store): as an actor, as part-owner of the Lord Chamberlain&#8217;s Men (later King&#8217;s Men), and as an investor in the Globe Theatre, Shakespeare threw himself directly into the hard work of forming relationships and dealing with his customers.  He made enough money to go back to his home town and buy the second-largest house &mdash; a mansion, really &mdash; and lord it over everyone he grew up with.</p>
<p>After all that work, perhaps he wrote his sonnets just for fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I installed the <a href="http://www.google.com/chat/voice/">Google Chat Voice</a> plugin today, and found that I was able to make free Google Voice calls from Canada to both a US and a Canadian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service">POTS</a> number.  I&#8217;m still unable to register for Google Voice at <a href="http://www.google.com/voice/">google.com/voice</a>, and I cannot use the Google Voice app on my Android phone, but at least I can initiate a call from inside GMail on my laptop now.</p>
<p>Does this mean that Google is about to roll out full Google Voice support for Canada, or just that they forgot to plug a hole in the code that that&#8217;s supposed to prevent non-US accounts from using the service?  </p>
<p>Google Voice on my Android phone would be fantastic, because I could make unlimited North American phone calls on (say) a 6 GB, $30/month data plan instead of paying the <a href="http://wirelessnorth.ca/2010/08/27/its-2010-and-canadians-pay-the-highest-cell-phone-bills-in-the-world/">world&#8217;s highest cell phone bills</a> for (limited) voice and long distance.  I&#8217;m sure <a href="http://www.rogers.com">Rogers</a> and other mobile carriers won&#8217;t be happy about that, but I hope their lobbyists can&#8217;t stop it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my university studies, I first encountered the idea of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Progress">Myth of Progress</a> — in 19th and 20th centuries a lot of people assumed that the world generally gets better each generation (aside from occasional blips like depressions or world wars), with less bigotry, better medicine, new technology, etc., but there&#8217;s no guarantee that any next generation will build on and improve the accomplishments of the previous one, and history&#8217;s movement may be more akin to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Case in point:</strong> in the information technology world, the greatest accomplishment of the most talented coders and business people in GenX was replacing the Baby Boomers&#8217; nasty old platform-dependent shrink-wrapped computer applications with open web applications that could run anywhere, from a Windows desktop to a Linux cell phone.  Write once, run all over the place on any hardware/OS you want.  GMail instead of Eudora.  Wikipedia instead of Encarta.  Cool, eh?</p>
<p><strong>So GenY comes along</strong> and says &#8220;hey: instead of encouraging people to browse the web with open standards, let&#8217;s build proprietary applications that run on only one type of mobile phone.  And we&#8217;ll allow only <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">one store</a></strong> to sell those applications for each type of phone, and every proprietary, platform-specific app will have to be preapproved and precensored by the phone manufacturer, who will extort^H^H^H^H^H^H be gladly offered a cut of sales.&#8221;  Even Microsoft in its monopolistic hey-day — before it became the toothless lion it is today — never had the balls to try anything like that with Windows apps.</p>
<p><strong>Who, ten years ago</strong>, would have predicted an IT catastrophe like this after so much progress and hope? It&#8217;s enough to make a person cry.  Let&#8217;s encourage those GenY&#8217;ers who taken up the torch and continue to work on the dream of an open web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/code.google.com/appengine/images/appengine_lowres.gif" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> (GAE) is the newest of the major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computing</a> platforms for hosting web applications.  I&#8217;ve been experimenting with it for a couple of days, and will post my impressions later.  For now, I thought it might be interesting to try to make sense of the pricing.</p>
<p>Unlike many of the other platforms, GAE starts out free.  Only when you pass the built-in quotas do you start paying for infrastructure usage.</p>
<p>Google has designed its <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html">free quotas</a> to allow approximately <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#quota">5 million pageviews per month</a>.  Before we look at what Google charges for passing that limit, let&#8217;s look at this number from a business perspective.  (Obviously, it will vary wildly depending on what a site does: a well-designed, read-intensive site might be able to get 10 million pageviews or more without passing the quota, while a poorly-designed, write-intensive site might struggle to fit in 1 million.  We&#8217;ll just stick with Google&#8217;s estimate for now.)</p>
<div id="free-quotas">
<h3>Free quotas and the boutique web site</h3>
<p>There are many ways for web sites to earn money, and some (such as membership fees) don&#8217;t correlate directly with pageviews.  Let&#8217;s assume, though, that like most web sites, yours is advertiser-supported.  In that case, the most important number to you is your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_mille">eCPM</a> (effective cost per mille), the mean revenue you earn for every 1,000 pageviews.  Some people claim very high numbers for this, like $20 eCPM, but they&#8217;re usually talking about either a low-traffic site, or what they get for a few premium direct ad sales before they splatter the rest of their pages with low-paying filler from ad networks.  When you average everything out, stick with sites with monthly pageviews in the millions, and consider <em>all</em> pageviews rather than just premium ad sales, about $0.50-$2.50 eCPM seems like a typical revenue range from my experience consulting with big and small companies.</p>
<p>A web site receiving 5 million pageviews/month, then, with ads on all the pages, would be earning ad revenue of $2,500–$12,500/month, or $30,000–$150,000/year.  Google has obviously chosen its free-quota cutoff carefully: that&#8217;s enough to support one person working on a boutique web site, or maybe two people working on the site part time, but not enough to support even a small company with employees, rent, etc.</p>
<p>Still, why is Google offering this for free while Amazon, for example, isn&#8217;t?  It&#8217;s the ad revenue.</p>
<p>Google runs what is by far the <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">most popular web site ad network</a>, so the odds are that most web sites on GAE will also be running Google ads.  Since Google <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2006/10/21/google-adsense-giving-publishers-average-of-78-revenue-share/">keeps about 25% of ad revenue</a> (at least back in 2006), a site hosted on Google App Engine for free, bringing in $75,000/year for the site owner in revenue from Google ads, likely generates about a $25,000/year ad commission for Google.  If AWS allowed a similar free quota, all they&#8217;d do is generate $25,000/year for Google as well, not for themselves.</p>
<p><!-- free-quotas --></p>
</div>
<div id="paid-usage">
<h3>Paid usage and the professional web site</h3>
<p>Once your site grows beyond that target, Google wants you to pay.  You still get the free quota every month first, so if you&#8217;re getting only (say) 7 or 8 million pageviews/month, and they&#8217;re evenly-distributed, you won&#8217;t be paying very much at all.  Let&#8217;s say, though, that you are <em>extremely and atypically</em> successful, and your site has grown to tens or hundreds of millions of pageviews, so that the free quotas become insignificant.  Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll be <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/billing.html#Billable_Quota_Unit_Cost">paying</a> as of 18 July 2009 (I&#8217;ve added the free quotas for comparison):</p>
<table border="border">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Item</th>
<th>Unit</th>
<th>Cost</th>
<th>Free quota</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CPU time</td>
<td>hour</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>6.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandwidth out</td>
<td>gigabyte</td>
<td>$0.12</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandwidth in</td>
<td>gigabyte</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stored data</td>
<td>gigabyte/day</td>
<td>$0.005</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Recipients e-mailed</td>
<td>E-mails</td>
<td>$0.0001</td>
<td>2000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since we know the unit cost and the free quotas, we can calculate the value of the free quotas:</p>
<table border="border">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Item</th>
<th>Unit</th>
<th>Cost</th>
<th>Free quota</th>
<th>Daily value</th>
<th>Monthly value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CPU time</td>
<td>hour</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>6.5</td>
<td>$0.65</td>
<td>$19.77</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandwidth out</td>
<td>gigabyte</td>
<td>$0.12</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.12</td>
<td>$3.65</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandwidth in</td>
<td>gigabyte</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>$3.04</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stored data</td>
<td>gigabyte/day</td>
<td>$0.005</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.01</td>
<td>$0.15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Recipients e-mailed</td>
<td>E-mails</td>
<td>$0.0001</td>
<td>2000</td>
<td>$0.20</td>
<td>$6.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="4"><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td><strong>$1.08</strong></td>
<td><strong>$32.70</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So the free quotas are worth US $32.70/month, and Google estimates that they can cover 5 million pageviews per month.  Let&#8217;s put those two numbers together:</p>
<p>$32.70 / 5,000,000 * 1,000 =~ $0.0065</p>
<p>In other words, if your site has the average resource usage Googe expects, the infrastructure cost of hosting on GAE is about two thirds of a cent for every 1,000 pageviews.</p>
<p>Yikes!</p>
<p>Even if that&#8217;s wrong by an order of magnitude, you&#8217;d still be looking at under $0.07 per thousand pageviews.  If you&#8217;re running Google ads on your pages at all, you&#8217;re probably making at least $0.50 eCPM, and likely closer to $1.00.  Google has, effectively, taken infrastructure costs right out of the equation for ad-supported sites.</p>
<p><!-- paid-usage --></p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions">
<h3>Other issues</h3>
<p>Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;ll make much money — it&#8217;s surprisingly hard to get a site up to even 100,000 pageviews/month, much less millions (and $100/month in ad revenue isn&#8217;t going to pay your rent) — but at least you&#8217;ll be spending your time worrying about the content and usability of your site, rather than the infrastructure, like most startups do.</p>
<p>Still, GAE isn&#8217;t necessarily the best choice, yet.  I&#8217;ve spent a couple of days experimenting with GAE to see if it can support my <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> web site (75,000 pageviews/month), with mixed results.  Because GAE has to operate transparently in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System">GFS</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable">BigTable</a> cloud, its free or low price comes with a lot of constraints: the datastore is missing many basic features I rely on in a relational database (e.g. views, joins, <del>and referential integrity</del>), there&#8217;s no local filesystem access, no threads, and  extremely weak support for backend computation such as aggregating information or importing data.</p>
<p>It used to be that you could use any programming language you wanted on GAE, as long as it was <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.  Now that GAE also supports a Java Virtual Machine (with some restrictions), you can run not only Java, but any JVM-based language such as JRuby (as long as it complies with GAE&#8217;s JVM restrictions), but you still can&#8217;t just dump a PHP app onto GAE and have it run: you&#8217;re basically going to have to rewrite the app from scratch.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the problem of putting your eggs in Google&#8217;s basket, so to speak — the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9971025-7.html">6+ hour outage last month</a> made it clear that cloud computing doesn&#8217;t guarantee better uptime than a dedicated server.  And if Google suddenly decides to increase their rates, it may be very difficult to move your code and data to a different site, unless you take very advanced precautions.</p>
<p>If you can live with the constraints, though, the pricing is certainly right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Megginson is a Canadian advertising guy who&#8217;s spending a lot of time with social media.  He&#8217;s just launched a new blog, <a href="http://workthatmatters.blogspot.com/">Change Marketing</a>.</p>
<h3>Nepotism aside &#8230;</h3>
<p>I think I would have included a link to this blog even if it weren&#8217;t my brother&#8217;s, because of passages like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Branding accesses our very nature as social animals, taking advantage of the good feelings we get out of loyalty and admiration towards other human beings in our tribe. But in the case of companies and products, the personality traits are conjured up in an anthropomorphic emotional construct. We &#8220;like&#8221; favourite brands. We &#8220;trust&#8221; them. And most importantly, we make them part of our tribal identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>and this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Traditional marketers consider setting up a Facebook presence as something you DO. The problem is, the presence is all about who you ARE.</p></blockquote>
<p>(From <cite><a href="http://workthatmatters.blogspot.com/2009/04/social-media-brand-dont-sell.html">Social Media: Brand, don&#8217;t sell</a></cite>.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m looking for February or March numbers, but according to <a href="http://www.housepriceindex.ca/Default.aspx">Teranet and the National Bank of Canada</a>, as of January 2009, house prices across Canada had dropped only 2.35% since January 2008 (that&#8217;s using CHPI, which is the more negative of the two major indices).  Here&#8217;s a breakdown by major cities:</p>
<table>
<col width="10em"></col>
<col align="center" width="5em"></col>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> City<br />
(West to east)</th>
<th> CHPI change<br />
(Jan 08-Jan 09)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Vancouver</td>
<td style="background:#FF3333;">-4.16%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Calgary</td>
<td style="background:#FF2222;">-8.2%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Toronto</td>
<td style="background:#FF4444;">-2.44%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ottawa</td>
<td style="background:#33FF33;">+2.11%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Montreal</td>
<td style="background:#44FF44;">+4.11%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Halifax</td>
<td style="background:#22FF22;">+1.24%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Why the disparity?  Calgary is an oil city.  When the recession hit and resource prices tanked, Calgary was the centre of a huge housing bubble because of high oil prices, and Vancouver was in a major real-estate bubble of its own because of the upcoming 2010 Winter Olympics, so both had further to fall — they&#8217;re just adjusting back to realistic market prices.</p>
<p>Toronto is the financial centre of Canada, and we all know what happened to the finance industry, but it has a very wide employment base outside of finance, and vibrant immigrant community, and a lot of pent-up housing demand, so I&#8217;m not surprised to see a more moderate fall there.</p>
<p>Ottawa is the capital, so it has government jobs as a cushion, but it&#8217;s also one of Canada&#8217;s leading tech centres.  While big companies like Nortel and Corel are in terminal decline, small tech companies around Ottawa are doing very well.  I live here, and as far as I can tell, for-sale signs on lawns still don&#8217;t stay up too long.</p>
<p>Montreal.  Montreal?  It was the awkward poor sibling of big Canadian cities for a couple decades after the whole separatism thing started (and people and head offices fled to Ottawa and Toronto), but it&#8217;s been coming back recently — the streets aren&#8217;t as dirty, the heroin addicts are panhandling more politely, and after all, it&#8217;s still Montreal.  Just like Manhattan in the 1970s at its dirtiest and most dysfunctional was still more fun than any other U.S. city, Montreal will always be the coolest Canadian city to visit.  The suburban (and English-speaking) west end of the island is a huge centre for pharmaceutical companies, and perhaps they&#8217;re doing well in the recession (I haven&#8217;t checked).</p>
<p>Not much to say about Halifax, which is a much smaller city than the others, except that it&#8217;s a nice place, and I&#8217;m glad to see they&#8217;re doing well.</p>
<p>Perhaps when I find February or March figures, the news will be worse; then again, as a measurement tool, <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/109971-the-problem-with-housing-stats">CHPI can make things look a lot worse than RSPI</a>, so it&#8217;s just as likely that things are better than these number suggest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought it would be interesting to run a simple test for Canada — take some key economic indicators, and see how far we&#8217;ve slipped.  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve tracked down so far:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5pt">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Indicator</th>
<th>Date</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Last seen<br />
(before October 2008)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>GDP</th>
<td>Q4 2008</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Basically, we&#8217;ve slipped back to between 2004 and 2007, depending on which indicator you look at (a little further, probably, if I included stock market indices).  That&#8217;s not great (and our population is a bit larger), but ask yourself this: how did you feel in 2004?  Were you as worried as you are now?  Did it feel like a depression then?</p>
<p>I know things aren&#8217;t great — especially for people who&#8217;ve been laid off and/or lost their retirement savings or homes — but I think the (mainly left-wing) pundits (journalists, bloggers, and politicians) who keep screaming words like &#8220;depression&#8221; are just exploiting fear to try to get more attention for themselves, just like the (mainly right-wing) pundits did with anti-terrorism fears after 2001-09-11.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a vicious circle, because they have to keep upping the ante to stand out from the others, until we&#8217;re all convinced we&#8217;ll be standing in soup lines tomorrow (assuming anyone can afford to supply us with soup).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re writing a business plan for your personal startup (the tech equivalent of the <em>Great American Novel</em> that every hack journalist plans to write), a report for your customers, or a proposal for your managers, sooner or later you&#8217;re going to have to describe a <strong>customer problem</strong> — the justification for creating a product or launching a project.</p>
<p>Frankly, the majority of customer problem descriptions I&#8217;ve seen and heard — including those I&#8217;ve been involved in — have been either poorly thought out or complete B.S.  I know I won&#8217;t always be allowed to use this, but as a consultant and as a poor fool who still dreams of his own startup, I&#8217;ve written a checklist of six criteria that a <em>real</em> customer problem must meet:</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses the <strong>customer&#8217;s language</strong>, not yours — if any words or ideas need to be defined or explained, then it&#8217;s probably not really a customer problem.</li>
<li>It describes a <strong>business need</strong> — it should not mention the proposed technical solution (such as a social network, CMS, etc.).</li>
<li>It is <strong>recognizable</strong> — the customer is already familiar with the problem or with a very similar one, and doesn&#8217;t need to be convinced that the problem exists (though she might not be aware of its severity).</li>
<li>It is <strong>quantifiable</strong> — even if you can&#8217;t assign a number yet, it is the kind of problem that has a cost expressed in <em>concrete</em> units such as money, time, subscriptions, support calls, page views, etc.</li>
<li>It is <strong>compelling</strong> — you can demonstrate potential benefits, savings, etc. that justify the time, cost, and effort for the customer to try to solve it.</li>
<li>It is <strong>succinct</strong> — you can <del>describe</del> <ins>summarize</ins> the problem meaningfully in a single, short sentence (of course, you&#8217;re always free to elaborate it somewhere else).</li>
</ol>
<p>The passing grade on this checklist is 100%. If only one checklist item is missing, the problem is likely just wishful thinking — if your product or project succeeds, it will be despite your idea of the problem, not because of it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It&#8217;s actually easy to come up with problem descriptions that meet all six criteria; what&#8217;s hard is coming up with problem descriptions that meet all six criteria <em>and</em> have credible technical solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m hearing rumours of small-scale layoffs from a few different places around Ottawa, mostly small-to-medium-sized companies.</p>
<p>Just a single layoff affects dozens of people:</p>
<ul>
<li>the person who&#8217;s let go</li>
<li>the person&#8217;s family</li>
<li>the managers who have to do the firing</li>
<li>the person&#8217;s work friends, who&#8217;ll miss the lunchtime chats and drinks after work</li>
<li>the person&#8217;s coworkers, who&#8217;ll have to pick up the extra load</li>
<li>people from other organizations or members of the public who had dealings with the person</li>
<li>the restaurant owner across the street, who always had a special curry set aside for his favorite customer</li>
<li>(and so on)</li>
</ul>
<p>When the slowdown became inescapable in November, many companies may have decided to postpone layoffs until after the Christmas holidays, out of kindness.  The holidays are over now, and today (January 5) is the first day everyone will be back at work, so there could be a lot of postponed pain hitting all at once.</p>
<p>Are these just a few isolated incidents, or will today be the day that the economic slowdown starts to seem real to people in the tech industry?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a government spends money, a few things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>it competes with the private sector for money, driving up inflation (or interest rates)</li>
<li>it competes with the private sector for products and services, driving up costs</li>
<li>it competes with the private sector for land, driving up property prices</li>
<li>it competes with the private sector for workers, driving up salaries</li>
</ol>
<p>During a boom, these are all bad things &mdash; when inflation, costs, and salaries are already too high, government spending just pumps more air into the bubble, leading to an even bigger bust later on (as we&#8217;re seeing this time around).</p>
<p>During a bust, it&#8217;s a different story.  With the spectre of deflation and negative interest rates, more competition for money is a good thing.  With companies laying off workers and struggling to stay afloat, more competition for products and services is a good thing.  With a collapsing property market, more competition for land is a good thing.  And with a huge pool of un- or under-employed workers, more competition for labour is a good thing.</p>
<p>So with so much potential good, why are stimulus packages usually a bad thing?</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s all in the timing</h3>
<p>Spending enough money to actually stimulate the economy out of a recession takes a lot of time.  Sure, governments can spend some fixing existing roads and bridges, repairing sewers, etc., but that&#8217;s chickenfeed.  To spend serious money and put people back to work, they need to do big stuff like new high-speed rail lines or highways, convention centres, etc.</p>
<p>Now, stop and think for a second.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that you have access to $20B, right now, to build a high-speed rail line down the U.S. West Coast from Seattle to San Diego.  When can you spend it?</p>
<p>First, you need to have public hearings.</p>
<p>Then you need to plan the line.</p>
<p>Then you need to negotiate with all the governments along the way.</p>
<p>Then you need an environmental assessment.</p>
<p>Then you need to put the work out for tender.</p>
<p>Then you need to expropriate some land, and deal with the court challenges from people losing their homes, parks, etc.</p>
<p>Then, 10-20 years later, you can start construction.</p>
<p>Granted, that&#8217;s an extreme case, but even something as simple as a new convention centre takes several years from first planning to the start of construction, with design, approval, tender, environmental assessment, etc.</p>
<h3>Inflating the next bubble</h3>
<p>And there&#8217;s the problem.  Maybe we&#8217;ll still be in a bust in several years, but maybe .. just maybe .. we&#8217;ll be in the middle of a world-wide boom.</p>
<p>Then all the money that governments are committing now will go not to pull countries out of the current recession, but to inflate another bubble that could make the next recession even worse.</p>
<p>Are there any options?  We could try to plan stimulus packages during the boom, not during the bust, so that they&#8217;re ready to go when we actually need them.  The problem is, how do you predict a bust 5-10 years in advance?  Are contractors and workers willing to wait an uncertain number of years to start work until the next recession is declared?</p>
<p>That is why stimulus attempts mostly fail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Senate made the right choice rejecting the auto industry bailout.</p>
<p><strong>This isn&#8217;t about class warfare:</strong> it doesn&#8217;t bother me that the CEOs took their bizjets from Detroit to Washington (CEOs take private jets so that they have more time to work on running their companies, not to show off), and many of the shareholders who stand to lose are private citizens&#8217; 401Ks and pension funds, not rich industrialists.</p>
<p><strong>This isn&#8217;t about environmental concerns:</strong> companies will make electric cars as soon as they think they can profit from them (would you buy an electric car as your principal car now, when you have to stop every 2-3 hours and plug it in overnight, the batteries are an environment catastrophe waiting to happen, and a lot of the electricity in the U.S. is generated from dirty coal?).</p>
<p><strong>This isn&#8217;t about free-market purism:</strong> sometimes even healthy private organisations do need a little bridge financing to get through hard times, and in rare cases the government has to be the financier of last resort.</p>
<p><strong>This <em>is</em> about not prolonging the agony:</strong> the existing three major North American car companies are obviously doomed, and all a little more money will do is delay the bankruptcies, mergers, and restructuring that might actually create a vibrant, healthy North American auto industry (maybe just one company instead of three).</p>
<h3>No money pit</h3>
<p>A bailout would also be a commitment to a money pit &mdash; after spending <del>$25B</del><ins>$14B</ins> now, would the U.S. government be able to say &#8216;no&#8217; to more in three months, when the industry burned through the first handout?  What about another three months after that?</p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t healthy companies going through a rough spot &mdash; they were dying slowly even during the boom, when the world auto industry was <strong>way</strong> over capacity for demand, and Detroit was losing hundreds or thousands of dollars on every car they sold.  GM <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/nov2008/bw2008117_534334.htm">burned through</a> USD 4.2B cash in 2008Q3 alone, and that was mostly <em>before</em> the market meltdown.</p>
<h3>Palliative care</h3>
<p>The U.S. auto industry won&#8217;t disappear, but it has to change, and that change is going to be painful for the workers, their families, and their communities.  It&#8217;s good that the U.S. government has decided not to make a pointless intervention leading to false hope and prolonged agony; now, though, it&#8217;s time to think about palliative care for the industry, while the workers grieve and then move on with their lives.  Can the government help?  How?  <del>$25B</del><ins>$14B</ins> to help communities would be a lot more useful than $25B into GM&#8217;s, Ford&#8217;s, and Chrysler&#8217;s petty cash boxes.  But how to spend it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> the site shopping cart is broken, and doesn&#8217;t properly remove items from the total owing &mdash; too bad.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.megginson.com/img/dg_logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one easy way: <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/26/drm-free-classical-music-deutsche-grammophon-launches-online-mp3-store/">via TechCrunch</a>, Deutsche Grammophon, the gold standard in renaissance/ baroque/ classical/ romantic/ orchestral/ opera/ etc. music (often confusingly referred to collectively as &ldquo;classical&rdquo;, roughly equivalent calling all popular music since 1890 &ldquo;rap&rdquo;), will start selling their catalogue as unprotected MP3s at midnight German time tonight (6:00 pm in New York City) at their new site <a href="http://www.dgwebshop.com/">dgwebshop.com</a>.</p>
<p>As a teenager in the late 1970s, I used to visit the <cite>House of Sound</cite> in Kingston (Canada), where they had thousands of DG records &mdash; probably most of the catalogue &mdash; packed in tight on on shelves lining a wall of the store.  I couldn&#8217;t always afford them, but I loved being able just to pull them out and take a look at the covers of the different famous recordings.  These days, the so-called classical music section of any but a couple of specialized stores in big cities like New York or London have maybe one or two rows of worthless classical-pop compilations hidden behind the DVDs of TV series nobody watched in the 1980s &mdash; no wonder people don&#8217;t shop at record stores any more.</p>
<p>We tech types have been claiming for a while that music companies could make more money selling unprotected digital music, so here&#8217;s the test.  I plan to give them a lot of my own money if the site actually works, though I should note a couple of caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many current DG buyers are audiophiles who won&#8217;t be satisfied with the sound quality of MP3s (which are optimized more for boom-boom music), so this will probably open a new market for DG rather than leaching their current one.</li>
<li>DG&#8217;s market is mostly affulent people outside the intense social environment of high school or university, so people will be less likely to share these MP3s &mdash; and even if they do, it will probably just act as a promo for the higher quality recordings.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope the site can handle the traffic.  Rock on, Deutsche Grammophon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em><strong>Summary:</strong> Perhaps the women who don&#8217;t choose computer programming are making a good choice, especially with the deteriorating working conditions, stagnant or falling salaries, and offshoring.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, we&#8217;ve had a few postings about women in computing (or the lack thereof) — see <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/14/DevChix">Bray</a>, <a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/archives/2007/06/14/tech-women/">Wood</a>, <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/30">Tenison</a>, and <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/20/Women">Bray (again)</a>, all ignited by a <a href="http://www.devchix.com/2007/06/09/let%e2%80%99s-all-evolve-past-this-the-barriers-women-face-in-tech-communities/">piece in devChix</a>.</p>
<p>These postings all assume that we need to <em>do something</em> to pull more women into coding.  Why?  Do we think there are there lots of women would be happy coding, but aren&#8217;t smart enough or motivated enough to choose the right careers for themselves, or are too timid to deal with any barriers unless someone comes along and dismantles them first?</p>
<div id="market">
<h3>Listen to the market</h3>
<p>In an age where we&#8217;ve come to trust central planning less and the free market more, why not try to learn from the labour market instead of trying to push it ways it doesn&#8217;t want to go?</p>
<p>If we assume that the majority of working women <em>are</em> smart, strong, motivated, and brave, then we can also assume that they have good reasons for choosing their careers.  And in fact, it turns out that their track record isn&#8217;t bad.  For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, women were grossly underrepresented in manufacturing and overrepresented in lower-paying service-industry jobs like retail.  But when manufacturing starting offshoring in the 1980s and 1990s, it was the women who were still working (often as managers, at this point), while the men were at home, depressed, collecting welfare cheques or trying to retrain for jobs that paid a fraction of what they used to earn.</p>
<p>Now, while there&#8217;s lots of work connected with tech, we see pure coding increasingly being offshored, the same way that manufacturing was 20 years ago.  There&#8217;s no shortage of women working in jobs connected with computers, but instead of coding, many women choose onsite consulting, training, marketing, and other jobs that are not only social but require face time with customers, and as a result, are much more difficult to offshore.</p>
<p>Of course, if you absolutely love coding, like I do (and most of the people reading this do), you&#8217;re going to work hard to try to find a way to keep doing it, whether you&#8217;re a man or a woman.  But if you don&#8217;t feel that burning love, why let yourself be dragged kicking and screaming into an industry where salaries are falling, jobs are fleeing, hours are increasing (bye bye weekends!), and workers are increasingly treated as interchangeable cogs on a development assembly line, without even the (questionable) union protection their parents had in their factory jobs 20-30 years ago?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers force companies to write page after page of end-user license agreements (&#8220;clause xix: The said user hereby indemnifies ACME Widgets against any harm caused to his/her pregnancy by use of this spreadsheet&#8221;) and disclaimers (&#8220;ACME Widgets does not intend that this flight-planning software be used to plan an actual flight or for any other aviation-related or planning-related activities&#8221;).  We live in a litigious society, so companies need to protect themselves from spurious lawsuits.</p>
<h3>But is that true?</h3>
<p>When I read blogs and other stuff written by lawyers, VCs, and other similar professionals, I&#8217;m usually struck by the <em>lack</em> of legal disclaimers &mdash; they don&#8217;t seem to worry so much when it&#8217;s their own necks on the line, or are satisfied with one very brief, casual-language disclaimer instead of pages of B.S.</p>
<p>That leads me to two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do disclaimers and long EULAs actually <em>work</em>?  Does the amount of legal text have any correlation (positive or negative) with the likelihood of being successfully sued?</li>
<li>Is legal mumbo-jumbo something that lawyers push on companies, or something that paranoid company execs demand from their lawyers (maybe because everyone else has it)?</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested in pointers to any studies, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dare Obasanjo just put up a posting with the title <cite><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=69141977-7514-443d-800b-1f95c1ff8dbe">Open Source is Dead</a></cite>.  Dare does happen to be a Microsoft employee, but his posting is none of the standard anti-Linux/OpenOffice/Apache/Firefox FUD.  Instead, he voices a question that&#8217;s been floating around for a while:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; how much value do you think there is to be had from a snapshot of the source code for eBay or Facebook being made available? This is one area where Open Source offers no solution to the problem of vendor lock-in.
</p></blockquote>
<div id="locked">
<h3>Let me out!!!</h3>
<p>In other words, as the Web replaces Microsoft Windows as the world&#8217;s favorite desktop/laptop software platform (it may be there already), what good is Open Source to ordinary computer user? Even if a web site happens to be built on Open Source software (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a> stack), I&#8217;m still locked in:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I move my address book and archived e-mail from Hotmail to Yahoo or GMail?</li>
<li>How can I move my blog (with all postings and comments) from Blogger to Bloglines or WordPress?</li>
<li>How can someone move her contact list and comments from MySpace to Facebook?</li>
<li>How can a buyer in Yahoo&#8217;s auction thingy verify my reputation on eBay?</li>
<li>How can I move my old flight plans from Aeroplanner to FBOWeb?</li>
<li>How can I move my sales contacts and data from Salesforce.com to Highrise?</li>
<li>How can I move my pictures <em>with their tags</em> from Flickr to Smugmug?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="open">
<h3>A crack of light under the door</h3>
<p>These are huge problems, and the solution is probably going to have a lot more to do with <strong>Open Data</strong> than with Open Source.  There are already a couple of minor successes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog reading sites almost universally support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> import and export, so that you can save the list of blogs you read from one site and move it to another.</li>
<li>Online wordprocessors and spreadsheets, of course, support the Microsoft Office formats and/or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a> formats and/or RTF and CSV. </li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s not much, though.  Open Source (and its predecessor buzzword, <em>Free Software</em>) have been very important over the past couple of decades, giving us choices beyond the Microsoft/Apple duopoly that chained our desktops (and forcing the duopoly to open up a lot) and smashing the big-iron vendor cartel that owned our servers, but as the world shifts from desktop to web-hosted software, it can&#8217;t take us much further.</p>
</div>
<div id="next">
<h3>Your data is the next big battle</h3>
<p>Open Source will still matter, of course (especially for server-side work), but it won&#8217;t be an important battle ground any more.  Until we can convince (or force) web sites to embrace and standardize on Open Data formats &mdash; XML, JSON, or even CSV, as appropriate &mdash; we will be in some ways even more locked in than we were in the bad old desktop days.  Celebrate Open Source&#8217;s victory, by all means, but get ready for an even bigger and bloodier battle over the next 10-20 years.</p>
</div>

<p>Elliotte Harold is absolutely right when he suggests that <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/java/why-java-doesnt-need-properties-it-already-has-them/">people should leave Java alone</a>.  New technologies compete on features; mature technologies compete on deployment.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s value our mature, middle-aged technologies for what they are, rather than destroying their dignity by pumping them full of features botox and slashing them up with plastic-surgery keyword changes to try to trick people into thinking they&#8217;re young and immature.</p>
<p>With some minor lapses, the W3C has done well avoiding the temptation to improve XML to death.  XML is still, in every way that matters, the same as it was when the initial recommendation came out nine years ago &mdash; warts and all &mdash; and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so widely used.  Sun should pay very close attention, since Java&#8217;s around the same age, and is deployed in many of the same places.  The people who actually decide to use Java and XML to run organizations and do real work (not bloggers, but architects, project managers and even sometimes CTOs) appreciate them for precisely that stability and dependability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are the top ten locations as of January 9 2007, according to <a href="http://google.com/trends?q=xml&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Google trends</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pune, India</li>
<li>Bangalore, India</li>
<li>Hyderabad, India</li>
<li>Chennai, India</li>
<li>Mumbai, India</li>
<li>Singapore, Singapore</li>
<li>Delhi, India</li>
<li>Tokyo, Japan</li>
<li>Chiyoda, Japan</li>
<li>Hong Kong, Hong Kong</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the top cities are all Asian.  A <a href="http://google.com/trends?q=j2ee&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">search for &#8220;J2EE&#8221;</a> returns almost exactly the same list.  Now, compare the list for a representative new, trendy technology, <a href="http://google.com/trends?q=ruby+on+rails&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Ruby on Rails</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>San Francisco, CA, USA</li>
<li>Austin, TX, USA</li>
<li>Pleasanton, CA, USA</li>
<li>Seattle, WA, USA</li>
<li>Salt Lake City, UT, USA</li>
<li>Portland, OR, USA</li>
<li>Vancouver, Canada</li>
<li>Denver, CO, USA</li>
<li>Oslo, Norway</li>
<li>Auckland, New Zealand</li>
</ol>
<p>This time, it&#8217;s 80% North American and 0% Asian, and more interestingly, all of those cities are <em>west</em> of the Mississippi.  The easiest interpretation of this very small sample is that the Asian companies concentrate on established technologies that they can be paid for using, while the North American west coast companies are disproportionately interested in new, unproven technologies.  What about a new technology that&#8217;s designed to work with an older one?  Could we expect a mix of Asian and North American west coast cities?  Here are the <a href="http://google.com/trends?q=xquery&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">top cities searching for &#8220;XQuery&#8221;</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>San Jose, CA, USA</li>
<li>Bangalore, India</li>
<li>Singapore, Singapore</li>
<li>Chennai, India</li>
<li>San Francisco, CA, USA</li>
<li>Mumbai, India</li>
<li>Pleasanton, CA, USA</li>
<li>San Diego, CA, USA</li>
<li>Washington, DC, USA</li>
<li>Hong Kong, Hong Kong</li>
</ol>
<p>The implication of this very unscientific survey is that you can determine the relative maturity of a technology by looking at the weighting of search origins between western North America and eastern Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early in the week, I posted about the <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2006/12/18/beginning-of-the-end-for-open-web-data-apis/">end of the Google search API</a>, and speculated that &#8212; since everyone else tends to copy Google &#8212; it might be the start of a general trend away from open data APIs and in favour of server-side AJAX widgets.  In response, Amit Kumar of Yahoo sent me an e-mail message (after failing to get past Spam Karma in the comment system for my blog):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to worry. We just posted a blog entry on this topic. Yahoo Search APIs are going strong &#8211; we welcome developers to use our APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000393.html">http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000393.html</a></p>
<p>Amit Kumar<br />
Manager, <a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com">Site Explorer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Amit.  Fortunately, <a href="http://www.megginson.com/">megginson.com</a> isn&#8217;t popular enough that it will break Yahoo&#8217;s 5,000 queries/day quota.</p>
<h2>SOAP, REST, JSON, XML, and Serialized PHP</h2>
<p>Note that Yahoo has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a> interface that can deliver results in XML, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, <em>or</em> <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/common/phpserial.html">serialized PHP</a>, so if people get tired of the REST vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> perma-debate, there&#8217;s some alternative material for you here (if you want a good roaring debate, be careful to avoid reading Tim Bray&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/21/JSON">carefully balanced view</a>).</p>
