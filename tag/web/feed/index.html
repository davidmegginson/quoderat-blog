					<description><![CDATA[Remember when we thought the web was stuck in a rut, with IE, Flash preroll, fixed-width layouts, and endless browser incompatibilities? <a href="https://quoderat.megginson.com/2014/08/23/its-never-the-end-of-history/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Link: </strong><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/">http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/</a></p>
<p>Ten years ago, circa 2004, it felt like the web had found its rut and would never get out: XML and XHTML had failed to fix the browser-incompatibility mess, the horrid Internet Explorer had achieved almost total browser-market dominance, and web designers were focussing on animated pre-rolls and big screens. Even in 2009, when the rise of mobile was impossible to ignore, Ethan Marcotte still sounded like an Isaiah shouting from the wilderness when he pleaded with us to think differently:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of exploring the benefits of flexible web design, we rely on a little white lie: “minimum screen resolution.” These three words contain a powerful magic, under the cover of which we churn out fixed-width layout after fixed-width layout, perhaps revisiting a design every few years to “bump up” the width once it’s judged safe enough to do so. “Minimum screen resolution” lets us design for a contrived subset of users who see our design as god and Photoshop intended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that we weren&#8217;t at the end of web history, but just finishing the first act. After a decade-long intermission of stagnation, things started changing even faster than they had in the optimistic early days of the mid 1990s. IE has become so irrelevant that it&#8217;s barely necessary to test against it any more (unless your audience is big industry or government office workers using obsolescent desktop computers), HTML5 and CSS3 have exploded, the Javascript ecosystem has matured, the majority of page views happen on small-screen mobile devices, and those devices ensure that most users always have the latest version of their browsers (a vain hope in 2004 or 2009).</p>
<p>Five years after Marcotte&#8217;s article, any so-called web designer proposing to work with a fixed &#8220;minimum screen resolution&#8221; would &#8230; and <strong>should</strong> &#8230; be fired. </p>
<p>Except maybe in government and big industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2013/07/17/transitioning-to-a-mobile-centric-world/">http://abovethecrowd.com/2013/07/17/transitioning-to-a-mobile-centric-world/</a></p>
<p>This article argues that the verdict is in, and users want apps, not mobile web sites.&nbsp; My friend and colleague Michael Roberts (who, I suspect, is neutral in the debate) shared this link on Google+, and &#8211; as if to prove Mr Gurley&#8217;s thesis &#8211; I read his posting in the Android G+ app, not the mobile site.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here is the comment I left:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interesting piece &#8211; thanks, Michael . He&#8217;s absolutely right that people prefer apps to the browser for common tasks, but I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s got the whole story.&nbsp; For example, like most people, I currently read G+, Facebook, and Twitter in the dedicated mobile apps rather than in the browser.&nbsp; However, a large plurality (if not majority) of interesting posts to those services are actually links back out into the web, so the result of of reading a tweet is generally opening not a dedicated app, but a web site.</p>
<p>Case in point &#8211; we&#8217;re both reacting to a pro-app/anti-browser article, but the only reason we know about it is that you were able to share a web link in your G+ post.&nbsp; If Mr. Gurley had created a &#8220;GurleyPosts&#8221; app for his thoughts, then (a) most people probably wouldn&#8217;t have it installed, and (b) you wouldn&#8217;t have been able to pass a link from iOS that I could use to read it on Android.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, for something I do a lot (read Facebook, check the weather, play a game, get driving directions) I will tend to use an app.&nbsp; But I <em>won&#8217;t </em>install a dedicated app just to read an article from a magazine or newspaper, and even when I am using an app, I need a <u>link</u> if I&#8217;m going to share it with anyone else.</p>
<p>So in 2013 for mobile, apps are for the tall head of any user&#8217;s activities, and the browser is for the long tail.&nbsp; Of course, every startup thinks it&#8217;s going to be the next Facebook (at least in terms of its importance to the people who use it), but few of them end up there, so the way people are going to find them is by following links from FB, Twitter, Google+, emails, chats, etc.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t give up on that mobile web site quite yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This passage recently appeared in a CBC story entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2011/04/12/teachers-twitter-facebook.html">Ont. teachers advised not to tweet with students</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Ontario College of Teachers says teachers should avoid connecting with their students on Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>They are also told to avoid contacting them on LinkedIn, Flickr, YouTube and MySpace.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a great idea to offer guidelines for how teachers communicate with vulnerable pre-College/University students; it&#8217;s too bad that the College revealed little other than its own ignorance in the way it wrote them.  In a sense, that&#8217;s our fault in IT, because we call a whole bunch of unrelated things &#8220;social media&#8221;, so we can hardly expect teacher-bureaucrats to distinguish between broadcasting publicly over Twitter and exchanging secrets with a select group of friends over Facebook.</p>
<h2>Not where you are, but what you&#8217;re doing</h2>
<p>So, let&#8217;s forget about red herrings like online vs. offline, social media, etc., and instead, propose two simple questions a teacher has to answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is it all taking place in the public view (can the student&#8217;s parents, my colleagues, my principal, etc. follow the exchange)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it related to my role as a teacher (am I using this information to help teach, or do I have non-professional motives)?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answer to both these questions is &#8220;yes&#8221;, then the communication is probably appropriate, whether it&#8217;s through the spoken word, paper, Twitter, Facebook, or any channel.</p>
<h2>Good and bad communication</h2>
<p>Here are some examples of how the questions play out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is OK, and often desirable, for a student to read public school-related information posted by a teacher, whether it&#8217;s on a bulletin board in the hallway, a Twitter feed, a blog, or a posting in a Facebook group.  &#8220;Public&#8221; means that the parents and principal can read it too.  It&#8217;s a good way for a teacher to communicate with the students (deadlines, assignments, study hints, etc.) and encourage discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is usually OK for a teacher to read public information posted by a student, whether it&#8217;s a letter to the editor in a newspaper, a Twitter feed, or a posting in a Facebook group.  The key is whether the information is related to the teacher&#8217;s role &mdash; for example, reading a feed of public political. literary or math tweets from a student is being a good teacher; scouring tweets (or any other public information, such as Google Streetview or the phone book) for personal information is stalking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is probably not OK for a teacher to open private communication channels with a student, where the communication can&#8217;t be seen by other teachers, parents, etc.  This would include passing private notes in the student&#8217;s locker, exchanging email (unless the parent or another teacher is CC&#8217;d on it), becoming Facebook friends, chatting privately using Jabber or MSN, or exchanging SMS text messages.  This is a bad idea even if the communication is meant to be strictly professional, because it leaves students open to manipulation, and teachers open to accusation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sound reasonable?  It&#8217;s not the <em>platform</em> (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) but the <em>activity</em> that matters.  As long as you keep everything out in plain view, talking and exchanging information is a good thing, online or otherwise.</p>

Productions.  Used with permission.</p></div>
<p>After making one mockup of the home page, we realized that it would take three clicks for a user simply to start watching this week&#8217;s episode:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on &#8220;episodes&#8221; on the home page.</li>
<li>Click on the latest episode at the top of the episodes page.</li>
<li>Click on the video to start it playing.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a web series, where the main point is to let people watch a new episode every week, this made no sense. We thought about a couple of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>We could embed a direct link to the current episode on the home page.</li>
<li>We could embed the current episode itself on the home page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Broken links and bookmarks</h2>
<p>The first option still required two clicks.  The second option had more subtle problems: let&#8217;s say that I went to sweettartstakeaway.com, watched the current episode, liked it, and sent you the link.  Two days later, you open your email, click on the link, and see an entirely <em>different</em> episode, because the current episode has changed.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a merely abstract problem.  Blogging sites (like those based on WordPress) typically put copies of the newest content on the home page.  I have followed hundreds of links to blog postings over the past few years, only to find that someone had linked to the blog&#8217;s <em>home page</em> instead of the specific blog posting, and the posting I wanted had long fallen off the home page.  Even search engine results do that sometimes.</p>
<h2>The <em>zero</em> option</h2>
<p>The solution we finally came up with seems simple only in retrospect &mdash; throw out the home page.  </p>
<p>When you direct your browser to <a href="http://sweettartstakeaway.com">sweettartstakeaway.com</a>, instead of yawning at a promotional page telling you how wonderful the web site is, you get  redirected automatically to the current episode page (on February 14, 2011, that was <a href="http://sweettartstakeaway.com/episodes/01">/episodes/01</a>).  Next Monday, you&#8217;ll be redirected to a different episode, and so on, for all 18 episodes. (We&#8217;re using a 307 redirect, for anyone who cares about HTTP status codes.)</p>
<h2>Give them what they want, not what <em>you</em> want</h2>
<p>With a web series, you know there&#8217;s one activity most visitors care about: watching this week&#8217;s episode.  When you <em>do</em> know that, why not let them start there, instead of forcing them to crawl through an ego-driven &#8220;home page&#8221; telling them how wonderful you are?</p>
<p>When the series is finished, and we archive it, we may add a home page then to give historical context for the whole series, with links to episodes.  For now, though, it will be interesting to see how our <em>zero-home</em> experiment works out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one would mistake me for a graphic designer &mdash; I believe that no merely visual design can match the breathtaking beauty of a properly-normalized database schema &mdash; but still, I recently found myself helping someone design a simple theme for a Drupal web site.  </p>
<p>The site owner was visually-focussed (poor woman, stuck with me as designer!), and had very specific ideas about where layout items and whitespace should go, so I decided that while I have issues with fixed-width layouts like the [in]famous <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid</a>, I shouldn&#8217;t make her suffer for my beliefs: I designed a fixed-width, em-based layout for her.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, she got in touch and said &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry, but &#8230;&#8221;.  She had been looking at the web site on a laptop up to that point, but the first time she opened it on her big monitor at work, it looked like garbage, a tiny strip surrounded by huge bands of whitespace.</p>
<h2>Window size: an obsolete problem?</h2>
<p>I mention this story because I just read a <a href="http://www.gantry-framework.org/documentation/joomla/advanced/960-grid-system">web page</a> that suggests that <em>fluid</em> layouts &mdash; web-page layouts that adjust themselves to fit the width of the browser window &mdash; are passé:</p>
<blockquote><p>
With the advancement in displays and the cheap prices of large 22&#8243; and 24&#8243; displays fluid layouts have quickly become more a hinderance than a help because you don&#8217;t run your browser full screen anymore. You generally run your browser alongside your mail client, your IM client, iTunes, etc. You find a common size for your browser that accommodates most sites, and you leave it at that width.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, apparently not.  At least, not in this case.  The argument seems to be that users will conform to the needs of designers, by carefully resizing their browser windows to make the designs look good, but the web site owner I&#8217;m working with wasn&#8217;t one of those people, and I suspect that not all her visitors will be, either.</p>
<h2>Rogues&#8217; gallery</h2>
<p>The designer of the web site proclaiming the demise of fluid layout probably hoped his or her site would look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png"><img data-attachment-id="426" data-permalink="https://quoderat.megginson.com/2011/02/09/is-fluid-layout-old-fashioned/fixed-normal/" data-orig-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png" data-orig-size="1265,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Fixed-width layout in an ideally-sized browser window." data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=640" src="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=640&#038;h=313" alt="" title="Fixed-width layout in an ideally-sized browser window." width="640" height="313" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-426" srcset="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=640&amp;h=313 640w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=150&amp;h=74 150w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=300&amp;h=147 300w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=768&amp;h=376 768w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png?w=1024&amp;h=502 1024w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-normal.png 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>This is what you&#8217;d see on a typical laptop screen, or on a window sized smaller on a big screen.  It&#8217;s beautiful &mdash; I freely admit that I could never design such a nice-looking web site.  </p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s how the same site would look in a large browser window on a large monitor:</p>
<p><a href="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png"><img data-attachment-id="427" data-permalink="https://quoderat.megginson.com/2011/02/09/is-fluid-layout-old-fashioned/fixed-big/" data-orig-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png" data-orig-size="1265,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Fixed-width layout in a very large browser window." data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=640" src="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=640&#038;h=313" alt="" title="Fixed-width layout in a very large browser window." width="640" height="313" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-427" srcset="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=640&amp;h=313 640w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=150&amp;h=74 150w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=300&amp;h=147 300w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=768&amp;h=376 768w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png?w=1024&amp;h=502 1024w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-big.png 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>OK, even I (and probably my guinea pig) can design something nicer-looking than that.  Damn those uncooperative users!  Why do they forget to size their browser windows properly?</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s go down-market, and see how the same site might look in a browser window on a tiny netbook (where the user doesn&#8217;t have the option of choosing a bigger window size):</p>
<p><a href="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="428" data-permalink="https://quoderat.megginson.com/2011/02/09/is-fluid-layout-old-fashioned/fixed-small/" data-orig-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png" data-orig-size="1265,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Fixed-width layout in a very small browser window." data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=640" src="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=640&#038;h=313" alt="" title="Fixed-width layout in a very small browser window." width="640" height="313" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-428" srcset="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=640&amp;h=313 640w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=150&amp;h=74 150w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=300&amp;h=147 300w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=768&amp;h=376 768w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png?w=1024&amp;h=502 1024w, https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fixed-small.png 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Not nearly as bad as the big screen, but awkward &mdash; I can sort-of see what the designer was trying to do, but I have to scroll around to get the whole effect: it&#8217;s like looking at the Mona Lisa in 5 cm² segments.</p>
<h2>Fluid vs fixed-width is a trade-off</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to conclude by saying &#8220;fixed-width bad, fluid layout good&#8221;, or any such oversimplification, but instead, to suggest that the tradeoff that existed between the two ten years ago still exists today:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want a web site that&#8217;s a respectable <strong>B-</strong> in a wide range of screen sizes, use a fluid layout (it&#8217;s not an accident that that&#8217;s what popular sites like Google use).</li>
<li>If you want a web site that&#8217;s a spectacular <strong>A+</strong> in one screen size, and a dismal <strong>D-</strong> in all others, use a fixed-width layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to demonstrate that you are capable of stunning visual beauty, if you know that most of your users will be viewing the site on a certain type of device, or if you just want to stoke your ego by winning design awards (and you know the resolution the selection jury will be using to view sites), then fixed-width can be a great choice.  For me, however, usability trumps style, so I&#8217;ll stick with fluid-width when I can.</p>
<p>And yes, for the record, you&#8217;re reading this blog (as of 2011-02-09) in a fixed-width layout.  I just use the default theme on wordpress.com with a custom picture in the banner, because I&#8217;m not really all that visually-focussed.  Maybe some day I&#8217;ll get around to seeing if I choose a WordPress theme with a fluid layout here, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile web users&#8217; needs differ by more than UI features (small touch screen): they may check information more often, and expect it to be fresher.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Last night, I finally got around to installing Google Analytics on <a href="http://ourairports.mobi/">ourairports.mobi</a>, the mobile version (for pre-smartphones) of <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">ourairports.com</a>, and this morning, I got my first stats: all of <strong>3</strong> visits yesterday (vs. 1,677 for the non-mobile site).</p>
<p>I expect that number to climb when the site is collecting stats for a complete 24-hour day, but already, I&#8217;ve noticed a significant difference in use:</p>
<table>
<col align="left"></col>
<col align="right"></col>
<col align="right"></col>
<col align="right"></col>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Site</th>
<th>Visits</th>
<th>Page views</th>
<th>Pages/visit</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mobile</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">3</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">93</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">31.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Desktop</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">1,677</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">4,748</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">2.83</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Of course, the mobile sample is too small to be statistically significant, but it still made me think about how a mobile user will use the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>A desktop user at home may check information for an airport once while planning a flight (as pilot or airline passenger).</li>
<li>A mobile user, at or on the way to the airport, will keep checking for changes (new weather forecast, NOTAMs, etc.), constantly updating the same few pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>A closer look at the analytics confirms that hypothesis, with a small number of airports updated multiple times (there were four pageviews for <a href="http://ourairports.mobi/airports/YPEF/">Sunbury Airfield</a> in Australia, for example).</p>
<p><strong>Further hypothesis:</strong> timely data is important for all web users, but it may be disproportionately important for mobile users.  If this is true, it&#8217;s probably worth spending less time trying to make your mobile site (or app) look like a fourth-year graphic design college project, and more time making sure that it has the best, and most recent information.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll watch the analytics for ourairports.mobi over the next month to see if this trend continues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Lord Byron" src="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lord-byron1.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></p>
<p>So what happened last week?  Did Google <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/opinion/08cringeley.html">backtrack after getting caught trying to be evil</a> about net neutrality and the mobile internet, or were they a <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Government-IT/The-Truth-About-Google-Verizon-and-Net-Neutrality-371606/">victim of a misunderstanding</a> (gleefully amplified by blood-thirsty Apple and RIM supporters)?</p>
<p><strong>Net neutrality</strong> is a crucial issue for those of us who care about open information.  We believe that the Internet is a public thoroughfare, where every information provider has the same access.  Competing web sites shouldn&#8217;t have their traffic slowed down because Google or Microsoft paid more money to Verizon, Rogers, or Bell, any more than you should have to pull to the side of the road to let someone in a more expensive car pass you.</p>
<h3>Carriers in search of a business plan</h3>
<p>For obvious reasons, the Internet providers don&#8217;t see it that way. They&#8217;ve ended up stuck in the rut of commodity service, with the inevitable race to the bottom for price, and are desperate to find some new revenue.  The mobile Internet providers are a little better off because they can at least lock customers into three-year contracts by giving them subsidized smartphones, but it&#8217;s still clear that someone like Verizon would be thrilled be able to take a big bag of money from Google in exchange for letting Google sites load a little faster than anyone else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that that&#8217;s not what Google was trying to do.</p>
<h3>Neutral in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">what sense</span>?</h3>
<p>The Google-Verizon kerfuffle draws attention to a different, and trickier part of the debate.  What if, instead of discriminating by provider (Google vs Facebook), carriers discriminated by traffic <em>type</em>? In other words, what if streaming audio and video got priority handling to avoid jerky playback, while e-mail was delayed an extra 2-4 seconds? All streaming video would get the same treatment, whether it comes from YouTube or a student&#8217;s dorm-room start-up, and all e-mail would get the same treatment, whether it&#8217;s from IBM or a LOL cats fan list.</p>
<p>According to Google&#8217;s CEO, Eric Schmidt, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/fcc-on-net-neutrality-yes-we-can.ars">this is what Verizon and Google were talking about all along</a>: not favouring one provider over another, but favouring one <em>content type</em> over another.</p>
<h3>Is it still evil?</h3>
<p>I expect that many people who support net neutrality for providers won&#8217;t feel so strongly about net neutrality for content types, because it doesn&#8217;t have the same appearance of unfairness.</p>
<p>Going back to the thoroughfare analogy, we have sidewalks where only pedestrians are allowed, paths where only cyclists are allowed, crossings that pedestrians aren&#8217;t allowed to use, and superhighways where only motor vehicles are allowed.  Buses and carpoolers are sometimes allowed to use a faster lane, trucks are sometimes required to stay in the slower lanes, and so on.  Why can&#8217;t we have different lanes for different kinds of network traffic, too?</p>
<h3>Net neutrality makes sense for content types, too</h3>
<p>There are, however, four compelling arguments in favour of net neutrality by content type as well as provider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pandora&#8217;s Box</strong> — it seems straight-forward enough to give streaming video priority over email, but how far might carriers take it?  Will carriers throttle IM during the next G8 summit to make it harder for protesters to organize?  Will government regulators prefer content types that are more popular among the old than the young?</li>
<li><strong>Business/content-type alignment</strong> — as the owner of the world&#8217;s top video site, Google has a strong interest in making video on the mobile web faster, even if it means that its competitors&#8217; videos are faster too. This kind of thing could turn evil fast — imagine Adobe and Apple in a bidding war to determine whether Flash should be delivered faster or slower than other content types, or the recording industry lobbying to throttle bittorrent so much that it becomes useless.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong> — the Internet already existed when HTML and HTTP arrived on the scene 20 years ago.  If the net hadn&#8217;t been neutral then, perhaps priority would have gone to important existing protocols like telnet and FTP, and HTTP (and HTML) might have been slow enough to turn off early adopters.  We don&#8217;t know what The Next Big Thing will be, but we do know that regulators respond slowly to change.  Why shut the door on innovation?</li>
<li><strong>Routing around censorship</strong> — seriously, how long will it take a few enterprising developers to realize that they can build an &#8220;accelerated download&#8221; app that allows other traffic to masquerade as video (or whatever has top priority).  Seconds?  Less?  You can make anything look like anything else on the Internet, and everyone thinks that his/her traffic is most important.</li>

<h3>It&#8217;s OK to be wrong sometimes</h3>
<p>Google is a company that <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/08/failure-is-always-option-at-google.html">embraces failure</a>, which, perhaps, is why it has so many successes: Google puts products out early, lets us play with them, then feeds the ones that succeed (e.g. Gmail) and kills the ones that don&#8217;t (e.g. Wave).</p>
<p>Perhaps Google is willing to try the same thing with ideas — they&#8217;re not necessarily evil for suggesting dropping net neutrality for content types, but they <em>are</em> wrong.  Let&#8217;s treat the whole thing as a failed project and move on, concentrating on making the net (mobile or desktop) faster for all providers, and all content types.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Nexus_One.png/200px-Nexus_One.png" alt="Nexus One" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had a few weeks to play with my <a href="http://www.google.com/phone">Nexus One</a>, I&#8217;m starting to grok the gut-level experience of living with a smart phone.  I understand why people download apps, how it feels to have the Internet with me everywhere, and what it&#8217;s like to experience the web by touch on a screen that&#8217;s only a few centimetres square.</p>
<h3 id="past">Past</h3>
<p>Device-specific apps are sweet and shiny at first, but after a couple of weeks, it becomes obvious that many of them are the encore of the floppy-based PC shareware world of the 1980s and early 1990s (<span style="color:green;">SEND $5 TO GET RID OF THE ANNOYING ADS!</span> <span style="color:red;">ONLY $10 FOR THE FULL VERSION!</span>).</p>
<p>Discovering an interesting app through Apple&#8217;s or Android&#8217;s market (or taking a picture of a barcode on your computer screen) is surprisingly awkward compared to just following a link from one web site to another, and as we&#8217;ve learned from the postal service, the telegraph, the telephone, email, and the web, connectivity always wins in the end.</p>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>Web apps run everywhere and connect to each-other seamlessly, and HTML5 allows a well-written web app to do <em>almost</em> everything a closed, device-specific app can do on a smart phone — many of the mobile web sites I&#8217;ve used (hello, <a href="http://m.google.com/">Google</a>!) are as good as or better than the corresponding device-specific apps.  There are some things, though, that make mobile web apps stand apart:</p>
<ul>
<li>The built-in buttons on your smartphone are tied to the browser, not to the app, so the Android menu or search button (for example) brings up a browser menu or search box, not an app one.</li>
<li>For good security reasons, a web app will probably never have as much access to the filesystem and device hardware as a closed device-specific app (do you want a malicious web app to be able to turn on your video camera when you&#8217;re browsing in bed?  do you ever consider that when you give a downloaded app access to your camera?).</li>
<li>While HTML5 supports notifications, you have to actually be on the web page to receive them.  That can be fixed by allowing the browser to launch web pages automatically on start/restart, but it&#8217;s still more awkward than an autostart app.</li>
<li>Web app processes need to be managed from inside the browser, not from a device-wide process manager.</li>
<li>As far as I know, there&#8217;s no way for a web app to install its own icon on the device home screen &#8212; the user has to install it manually (though it&#8217;s pretty easy).</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t consider most of these to be a big deal, but they do point to the fact that no matter how much extra functionality HTML5 provides, web apps have a different world view: they&#8217;re nodes in a huge network, not standalone silos.</p>
<h3 id="present">Present</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably have to continue to use a device-specific app for anything related to playing music or capturing photos/video for a while longer, and I&#8217;ll hang onto the Android WiFi analyzer I&#8217;m running on my phone.  Android has a lot of the same apps that show up in iPhone commercials (like <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/">Urban Spoon</a>), but while they&#8217;re pretty, they&#8217;re limited in the end — there&#8217;s way more out there on the web than there will ever be an an app store.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an person or organization that wants to interact with people on mobile devices, you have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can develop and maintain separate apps for iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Palm, and any other smart-phone OS&#8217;s that may come along, and let the phone vendors be gatekeepers between you and your users.</li>
<li>You can run a single mobile web app on your own server, one that&#8217;s only a click away from any other web site that links to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first option lets you force an icon onto the users desktop, but the direct development costs and opportunity costs of losing inbound links and search-engine love just seem too high.</p>

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;font-size:smaller;color:#444444;"><p>I left this comment on Simon St-Laurent&#8217;s interesting and thoughtful post <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/01/how-dare-apple.html">How dare Apple &#8230;</a> (which, in turn, was partly a response to Tim Bray&#8217;s post <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/27/iPad">Nothing Creative</a>).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that most things, including the iPad, are obviously right or wrong, but I do have serious concerns that go beyond simply not being able to code on an iPad (at least, until <em>there&#8217;s an app for that</em>).  I&#8217;m copying my comment here to give it a more permanent home.  If I hadn&#8217;t posted this yet, I&#8217;d edit it to tone down the emotional language 10% or so, but still, it&#8217;s a fair reflection of my thoughts and concerns, not about the iPad itself (it&#8217;s just another consumer device), but about the way people are starting to talk and think about issues that are very important to me, like software freedom:</p></blockquote>
<p>The thing about creativity is that it responds poorly to central planning and central control. I have no problem with the fact that the iPad isn&#8217;t developer-friendly &#8212; I can buy a Netbook with twice the power for half the price and code on it (and, BTW, that netbook makes just as simple a consumer device).</p>
<p>My problem is the idea that a single Apple politburo controls everything that can appear on the device. Is that the future? Even in the bad old days of TV, before cable, there were 3 1/2 US networks to choose from, not just one &#8211; you had to watch TV outside the US to see just how bad things could get with a single, government-controlled broadcaster (I grew up in Canada, but close enough to watch the US stations, thank god).</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s obsession with central control goes beyond software to hardware. There must be some kind of port for the optional keyboard to plug into, but no way it&#8217;s going to be USB or Firewire, because that might let someone use an *unplanned* creative device on the iPad, someone creative daring not to give Apple its cut (and veto). If I build something clever for creative people using a USB interface, it will work with desktop towers, notebooks, netbooks, and even some small portable devices, but *not* with the iPad.</p>
<p>Apple has some smart people working there, but they won&#8217;t always have the best ideas, and Apple has thrown up too many barriers to other people with smart ideas. The best apps in the future are going to come from a couple of students coding in a dorm room, and they might just be so annoyed by Apple censorship that they defect to a freer platform. It&#8217;s sad that things have gotten to the point that even Windows is a freer platform than Apple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my university studies, I first encountered the idea of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Progress">Myth of Progress</a> — in 19th and 20th centuries a lot of people assumed that the world generally gets better each generation (aside from occasional blips like depressions or world wars), with less bigotry, better medicine, new technology, etc., but there&#8217;s no guarantee that any next generation will build on and improve the accomplishments of the previous one, and history&#8217;s movement may be more akin to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Case in point:</strong> in the information technology world, the greatest accomplishment of the most talented coders and business people in GenX was replacing the Baby Boomers&#8217; nasty old platform-dependent shrink-wrapped computer applications with open web applications that could run anywhere, from a Windows desktop to a Linux cell phone.  Write once, run all over the place on any hardware/OS you want.  GMail instead of Eudora.  Wikipedia instead of Encarta.  Cool, eh?</p>
<p><strong>So GenY comes along</strong> and says &#8220;hey: instead of encouraging people to browse the web with open standards, let&#8217;s build proprietary applications that run on only one type of mobile phone.  And we&#8217;ll allow only <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">one store</a></strong> to sell those applications for each type of phone, and every proprietary, platform-specific app will have to be preapproved and precensored by the phone manufacturer, who will extort^H^H^H^H^H^H be gladly offered a cut of sales.&#8221;  Even Microsoft in its monopolistic hey-day — before it became the toothless lion it is today — never had the balls to try anything like that with Windows apps.</p>
<p><strong>Who, ten years ago</strong>, would have predicted an IT catastrophe like this after so much progress and hope? It&#8217;s enough to make a person cry.  Let&#8217;s encourage those GenY&#8217;ers who taken up the torch and continue to work on the dream of an open web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve used tabbed layouts in web sites for a while without thinking much about it.  I find them less obtrusive than menus, and have always believed that the idiom was familiar to nearly all users because of desktop applications.  Here&#8217;s an example of the tabbed interface at <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> as of 5 August, 2009:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.megginson.com/img/ourairports-tabs.png" alt="OurAirports tabs, 2009-08-05" /></p>
<p>The &#8220;Airport&#8221; tab has bold text, and a white background that runs smoothly into the rest of the page, while the other tabs have a light-blue background, blue text, and a line at the bottom separating them from the page — that should make it obvious to everyone that &#8220;Airport&#8221; represents the current page, while the others represent alternative pages that you can view by clicking on them.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Err, maybe not.  Even though it doesn&#8217;t look linky, the active tab is still, by a lucky coincidence, a link, so I was able to track it using the Google Analytics <cite>Site Overlay</cite> out-link tracker (note that it&#8217;s not actually a click tracker, even if it looks like one).  I have over 40,000 airport pages like this, so I can&#8217;t check every one, but the few dozen I looked at all told the same, sad story&#8230;</p>
<h3>People don&#8217;t get tabbed interfaces</h3>
<p>On most airport pages, the majority of user clicks were on the active &#8220;Airport&#8221; tab.  In other words, people go to the page, see the word &#8220;Airport&#8221; in bold in a prominent position, and click on it.  They <em>don&#8217;t</em> notice that it&#8217;s the active tab — maybe they don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s a tab at all.  They just figure that it must have more information about the airport they&#8217;re looking at.</p>
<p>For example, on the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/EGLL/">Heathrow Airport</a> page over the past month, Google Analytics tracked 17 outlinks to the same page (via the active &#8220;Airport&#8221; tab), 5 to airport arrivals, 4 to airport departures, and 0-2 for every other link.</p>
<p>Once they click on what I thought they&#8217;d recognize as the active airport tab, the same page just reloads.  Blech.  I assume that&#8217;s when they get sick of the site, and go back to their Google search results to find a better page about the airport.</p>
<h3>Tabs encourage information clutter</h3>
<p>So the tabbed interface just leads to confusion and frustration from many of the visitors to my web site.  But there&#8217;s another problem evident from the the outlink stats: tabs encourage a designer to present too many options in too many contexts.  The tabs are all visible on every page they cover, but most of the time, they represent information that the users don&#8217;t actually need, and there&#8217;s no clear visual cue that some of the tabs (e.g. arrivals and departures) are a lot more interesting than others (e.g. the airport page&#8217;s change history).</p>
<p>Here, for example, are the last month&#8217;s outlink counts for each of the tabs on the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/KMYR/">Myrtle Beach International Airport</a> page:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Tab</th>
<th># followed</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Airport</td>
<td>33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Arrivals</td>
<td>36</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Departures</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pilot info</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Visitors</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nearby airports</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nearby members</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Changes</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Edit</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For reasons I don&#8217;t understand, this was the most-visited airport page on OurAirports last month, with 371 pageviews (300 uniques).  It&#8217;s a little atypical, in that the active tab is not the most clicked (though it&#8217;s still unacceptably high), but otherwise, it shows the picture well.  The &#8220;Pilot info&#8221; tab has existed for only a few days, so we can leave it out, but in general, it&#8217;s clear that the main thing accomplished by the tabs is showing a lot of links at the top of every page that no one actually wants to use.  I suspect that even the four clicks on the &#8220;Visitors&#8221; tab were accidental — instead of trying to see what OurAirports members have visited the airport, people were probably just looking for visitor information.</p>
<h3>How to redesign?</h3>
<p>So if (a) tabs aren&#8217;t actually intuitive for most of my visitors, and (b) they fail to distinguish useful/popular information from more esoteric information, then they have to go.  It&#8217;s going to take me a while to redesign the site, but what I think I&#8217;ll do is highlight the 3-5 most useful actions for each type of page in a side bar beside the map, like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Show me&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>arrivals or departures</li>
<li>visitor comments</li>
<li>pilot information</li>
<li>nearby airports</li>
<li>points of interest</li>
<li>more&#8230;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A list like this, as opposed to tabs, provides a clear call to action for a page visitor, providing more detailed options in language that will make sense to them.  It highlights useful information they might have missed in a tab (e.g. pilot info) or a section lower on the page (e.g. Visitor comments), and hides stuff they rarely need in a menu that appears only on demand, when they click &#8220;More&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Farewell, tabs.  Even if you weren&#8217;t helpful, you were fun to design with CSS and rounded-corner images.</p>

Here, in no particular order, are some of my lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The OpenWave browser is horrendous, ignoring character encoding, randomly skipping some simple CSS, etc., but it&#8217;s one of the most common on small cell phones, so you have to live with it.</li>
<li>Some Nokia browsers will accept a 302 redirect but consider a 303 to be an HTTP error.</li>
<li>Cell phone browsers all seem to display the <var>title</var> element at the top of the screen, so if you have the same text in <var>title</var> and <var>h1</var>, it will appear twice, probably filling the whole first page.  If I leave it out, though, what happens on bigger screens like the iPhone or Blackberry?</li>
<li>Breadcrumbs are a bad idea for mobile pages, because they use a lot of screen real-estate on a cell phone.  I might move mine to the bottom.</li>
<li>Making too many things into links is a bad idea, because it takes a long time to scroll though them.</li>
<li>Even small graphics take a <em>long</em> time to load.  If there&#8217;s no good reason, don&#8217;t make people download any.  Including your corporate logo is not a good reason.  Use colors instead of graphics when you can.</li>
<li>OpenWave (and, I assume, other browsers) do not choose intelligent default font sizes for <var>h1</var>, etc. — they&#8217;ll fill the whole screen if you don&#8217;t change them with CSS.</li>
<li>When only a couple of dozen words fit on a screen at once, verbosity is a bad thing.  Ask yourself &#8220;can I say it with fewer words&#8221;?  Then do the same thing four or five times more. I&#8217;m still working on that.</li>
<li>Short previews are a good idea for things like comment lists, to save scrolling time.  Leave out as much as possible (for example, I don&#8217;t give the date of a comment unless the user views the full comment).</li>
<li><strong>Always</strong> including &#8220;jump to&#8221; links at the top of every page to save scrolling.</li>
<li>Extra stuff you&#8217;d normally put at the top of a web page, like a search box, login info, home link, etc., belongs at the <em>bottom</em> of a mobile web page, so that users don&#8217;t have to scroll past it to get to the content.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll add more as I discover it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/code.google.com/appengine/images/appengine_lowres.gif" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> (GAE) is the newest of the major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computing</a> platforms for hosting web applications.  I&#8217;ve been experimenting with it for a couple of days, and will post my impressions later.  For now, I thought it might be interesting to try to make sense of the pricing.</p>
<p>Unlike many of the other platforms, GAE starts out free.  Only when you pass the built-in quotas do you start paying for infrastructure usage.</p>
<p>Google has designed its <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html">free quotas</a> to allow approximately <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#quota">5 million pageviews per month</a>.  Before we look at what Google charges for passing that limit, let&#8217;s look at this number from a business perspective.  (Obviously, it will vary wildly depending on what a site does: a well-designed, read-intensive site might be able to get 10 million pageviews or more without passing the quota, while a poorly-designed, write-intensive site might struggle to fit in 1 million.  We&#8217;ll just stick with Google&#8217;s estimate for now.)</p>
<div id="free-quotas">
<h3>Free quotas and the boutique web site</h3>
<p>There are many ways for web sites to earn money, and some (such as membership fees) don&#8217;t correlate directly with pageviews.  Let&#8217;s assume, though, that like most web sites, yours is advertiser-supported.  In that case, the most important number to you is your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_mille">eCPM</a> (effective cost per mille), the mean revenue you earn for every 1,000 pageviews.  Some people claim very high numbers for this, like $20 eCPM, but they&#8217;re usually talking about either a low-traffic site, or what they get for a few premium direct ad sales before they splatter the rest of their pages with low-paying filler from ad networks.  When you average everything out, stick with sites with monthly pageviews in the millions, and consider <em>all</em> pageviews rather than just premium ad sales, about $0.50-$2.50 eCPM seems like a typical revenue range from my experience consulting with big and small companies.</p>
<p>A web site receiving 5 million pageviews/month, then, with ads on all the pages, would be earning ad revenue of $2,500–$12,500/month, or $30,000–$150,000/year.  Google has obviously chosen its free-quota cutoff carefully: that&#8217;s enough to support one person working on a boutique web site, or maybe two people working on the site part time, but not enough to support even a small company with employees, rent, etc.</p>
<p>Still, why is Google offering this for free while Amazon, for example, isn&#8217;t?  It&#8217;s the ad revenue.</p>
<p>Google runs what is by far the <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">most popular web site ad network</a>, so the odds are that most web sites on GAE will also be running Google ads.  Since Google <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2006/10/21/google-adsense-giving-publishers-average-of-78-revenue-share/">keeps about 25% of ad revenue</a> (at least back in 2006), a site hosted on Google App Engine for free, bringing in $75,000/year for the site owner in revenue from Google ads, likely generates about a $25,000/year ad commission for Google.  If AWS allowed a similar free quota, all they&#8217;d do is generate $25,000/year for Google as well, not for themselves.</p>
<p><!-- free-quotas --></p>
</div>
<div id="paid-usage">
<h3>Paid usage and the professional web site</h3>
<p>Once your site grows beyond that target, Google wants you to pay.  You still get the free quota every month first, so if you&#8217;re getting only (say) 7 or 8 million pageviews/month, and they&#8217;re evenly-distributed, you won&#8217;t be paying very much at all.  Let&#8217;s say, though, that you are <em>extremely and atypically</em> successful, and your site has grown to tens or hundreds of millions of pageviews, so that the free quotas become insignificant.  Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll be <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/billing.html#Billable_Quota_Unit_Cost">paying</a> as of 18 July 2009 (I&#8217;ve added the free quotas for comparison):</p>
<table border="border">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Item</th>
<th>Unit</th>
<th>Cost</th>
<th>Free quota</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CPU time</td>
<td>hour</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>6.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandwidth out</td>
<td>gigabyte</td>
<td>$0.12</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandwidth in</td>
<td>gigabyte</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stored data</td>
<td>gigabyte/day</td>
<td>$0.005</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Recipients e-mailed</td>
<td>E-mails</td>
<td>$0.0001</td>
<td>2000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since we know the unit cost and the free quotas, we can calculate the value of the free quotas:</p>
<table border="border">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Item</th>
<th>Unit</th>
<th>Cost</th>
<th>Free quota</th>
<th>Daily value</th>
<th>Monthly value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CPU time</td>
<td>hour</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>6.5</td>
<td>$0.65</td>
<td>$19.77</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandwidth out</td>
<td>gigabyte</td>
<td>$0.12</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.12</td>
<td>$3.65</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandwidth in</td>
<td>gigabyte</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
<td>$3.04</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stored data</td>
<td>gigabyte/day</td>
<td>$0.005</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.01</td>
<td>$0.15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Recipients e-mailed</td>
<td>E-mails</td>
<td>$0.0001</td>
<td>2000</td>
<td>$0.20</td>
<td>$6.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="4"><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td><strong>$1.08</strong></td>
<td><strong>$32.70</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So the free quotas are worth US $32.70/month, and Google estimates that they can cover 5 million pageviews per month.  Let&#8217;s put those two numbers together:</p>
<p>$32.70 / 5,000,000 * 1,000 =~ $0.0065</p>
<p>In other words, if your site has the average resource usage Googe expects, the infrastructure cost of hosting on GAE is about two thirds of a cent for every 1,000 pageviews.</p>
<p>Yikes!</p>
<p>Even if that&#8217;s wrong by an order of magnitude, you&#8217;d still be looking at under $0.07 per thousand pageviews.  If you&#8217;re running Google ads on your pages at all, you&#8217;re probably making at least $0.50 eCPM, and likely closer to $1.00.  Google has, effectively, taken infrastructure costs right out of the equation for ad-supported sites.</p>
<p><!-- paid-usage --></p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions">
<h3>Other issues</h3>
<p>Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;ll make much money — it&#8217;s surprisingly hard to get a site up to even 100,000 pageviews/month, much less millions (and $100/month in ad revenue isn&#8217;t going to pay your rent) — but at least you&#8217;ll be spending your time worrying about the content and usability of your site, rather than the infrastructure, like most startups do.</p>
<p>Still, GAE isn&#8217;t necessarily the best choice, yet.  I&#8217;ve spent a couple of days experimenting with GAE to see if it can support my <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> web site (75,000 pageviews/month), with mixed results.  Because GAE has to operate transparently in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System">GFS</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable">BigTable</a> cloud, its free or low price comes with a lot of constraints: the datastore is missing many basic features I rely on in a relational database (e.g. views, joins, <del>and referential integrity</del>), there&#8217;s no local filesystem access, no threads, and  extremely weak support for backend computation such as aggregating information or importing data.</p>
<p>It used to be that you could use any programming language you wanted on GAE, as long as it was <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.  Now that GAE also supports a Java Virtual Machine (with some restrictions), you can run not only Java, but any JVM-based language such as JRuby (as long as it complies with GAE&#8217;s JVM restrictions), but you still can&#8217;t just dump a PHP app onto GAE and have it run: you&#8217;re basically going to have to rewrite the app from scratch.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the problem of putting your eggs in Google&#8217;s basket, so to speak — the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9971025-7.html">6+ hour outage last month</a> made it clear that cloud computing doesn&#8217;t guarantee better uptime than a dedicated server.  And if Google suddenly decides to increase their rates, it may be very difficult to move your code and data to a different site, unless you take very advanced precautions.</p>
<p>If you can live with the constraints, though, the pricing is certainly right.</p>
<p><!-- conclusions --></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I discovered an interesting link scam in my inbox this morning, with the subject line &#8220;New Chicago O&#8217;Hare International Airport website&#8221;.  The message informed me that Chicago O&#8217;Hare Airport has a new website at <code>ohare-airport.org</code>, and asked me to update my link to the airport.  The link points to a pretty credible looking site, with arrivals and departures information, ground transportation, and even a privacy policy (!)  The only clue that something&#8217;s wrong is the very vague copyright information (&#8220;© Airport Administration Services&#8221;) and the lack of a phone number or mailing address on the contact page.</p>
<p>I run a community airport website named <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a>, so it&#8217;s not unusual for me to get e-mail from smaller airports and flying clubs with updates, but big airports have never bothered with me.</p>
<p>As one would expect, O&#8217;Hare Airport&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flychicago.com/OHare/OHareHomepage.shtm">existing web site</a> makes no mention of a new, updated site.  In this scam the scammer is not phishing for personal information or trying to scam money, but instead, is trying to get pagerank over the official O&#8217;Hare site by tricking thousands of sites into providing links.</p>
<p>What are they looking for?  Given that the e-mail traces back to a site called <code>huntparking.com</code>, I&#8217;ll guess that they want to use the web traffic either to sell ads for airport parking or to sell their own parking.</p>
<p>The <a href="#message">e-mail</a> and <a href="#whois">whois info</a> are below.  Nicely done, by the way &#8212; the fake site is much better designed than O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s real site, and even the markup snippet in the e-mail is XHTML-compatible.  Perhaps O&#8217;Hare Airport should consider hiring the designer instead of bringing charges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Megginson is a Canadian advertising guy who&#8217;s spending a lot of time with social media.  He&#8217;s just launched a new blog, <a href="http://workthatmatters.blogspot.com/">Change Marketing</a>.</p>
<h3>Nepotism aside &#8230;</h3>
<p>I think I would have included a link to this blog even if it weren&#8217;t my brother&#8217;s, because of passages like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Branding accesses our very nature as social animals, taking advantage of the good feelings we get out of loyalty and admiration towards other human beings in our tribe. But in the case of companies and products, the personality traits are conjured up in an anthropomorphic emotional construct. We &#8220;like&#8221; favourite brands. We &#8220;trust&#8221; them. And most importantly, we make them part of our tribal identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>and this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Traditional marketers consider setting up a Facebook presence as something you DO. The problem is, the presence is all about who you ARE.</p></blockquote>
<p>(From <cite><a href="http://workthatmatters.blogspot.com/2009/04/social-media-brand-dont-sell.html">Social Media: Brand, don&#8217;t sell</a></cite>.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Canada, people who have served time for a wrongful murder conviction become famous &mdash; <em>very</em> famous &mdash; and stay that way for years and decades.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Truscott">Steven Truscott</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Marshall,_Jr.">Donald Marshall Jr.</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Milgaard">David Milgaard</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Paul_Morin">Guy Paul Morin</a> are arguably household names, better known than many celebrities (including most medal-winning Canadian Olympic athletes, award-winning musicians, etc.)</p>
<p>Truscott&#8217;s initial wrongful conviction took place 40 years ago, but if anything, he&#8217;s better known now than any time before.  Three men with more recentky-overturned convictions &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baltovich">Robert Baltovich</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mullins-Johnson">Bill Mullins-Johnson</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Driskell">James Driskell</a> &mdash; are also getting on-going press coverage, TV documentaries, etc.</p>
<p>I had never thought anything unusual about this phenomenon, until the Mullins-Johnson article was suddenly deleted from Wikipedia, with no debate &mdash; the Wikipedia editor had assumed that a wrongful conviction was so obviously unnotable that no discussion was required, but when I objected, he did restore the article and start a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bill_Mullins-Johnson">proper RFD debate</a>.</p>
<p>When Wikipedia has articles about minor, imaginary videogame characters, it seemed unimaginable to me at first that editors would try to delete an article about a real, famous person, but so far, there seems little support for keeping the article.  Thinking about it, I suddenly realized that the wrongfully-convicted <em>aren&#8217;t</em> famous in the U.S.  Sure, I could Google around and find a few names, but in the U.S., serving 10 years for a murder you didn&#8217;t commit does not automatically make you a household name &mdash; in fact, it might not even result in a national news story.</p>
<p>Perhaps there&#8217;s a strong feeling of discomfort around the issue in a country that still executes so many of its citizens.  Or perhaps, because the wrongly-convicted often have prior criminal records, Americans don&#8217;t feel that their convictions were such a serious injustice.  Many U.S. jurisdictions (all?) have very small limits on the compensation you can receive for a wrongful conviction, while in Canada, someone who has been in jail for years could receive well over $1M &mdash; a big news story in itself.</p>
<p>I have a conflict of interest with the RFD for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mullins-Johnson">Bill Mullins-Johnson</a> article because I was the original author (though many others have since contributed), but if the article is going to be deleted, I&#8217;d hate it to be simply from lack of debate.  So, Wikipedia users, whether you agree or disagree with me, please visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bill_Mullins-Johnson">RFD page</a> and have your say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a></strong> lets members tag airports to create different kinds of maps.  I&#8217;ve created two maps that show very vividly where the intersections of people, money, and land occur in the world.</p>
<h2>Welcome to the club &#8230;</h2>
<p>The first tag, <strong><var><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/top150/">top150</a></var></strong>, shows the world&#8217;s 150 busiest airports by passenger traffic (as of 2007).  Central Africa has lots of people, but not much money, so it&#8217;s empty.  Australia and Canada have high per-capita incomes but a low population density, so they also appear mostly empty in the map, with only a handful of top-150 airports each.  The U.S. has a lot of land but also a lot of money and a lot of people, so it&#8217;s very full.  India and the Persian Gulf countries are starting to fill up, as incomes rise and more people travel.</p>
<h2>&#8230; but not <em>this</em> club</h2>
<p>The second tag, <strong><var><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/top30/">top30</a></var></strong>, shows a much more exclusive club, the world&#8217;s 30 busiest airports by passenger traffic.  These are the absolute busiest hubs, and it takes a rich <em>and</em> populous city or country to support one.  Not by accident, fully half of these airports (15) are in the United States, and 8 more are in Western Europe, leaving only 7 for the rest of the world to share.</p>
<p>In this club, the 1.3 billion citizens of China are represented by only two airports (including Hong Kong), and the 1.2 billion citizens of India are not represented at all.  Canada and Australia also don&#8217;t make the cut (too few people).</p>
<p>Of course, there are other considerations: aside from its money, land, and people, the heavy air passenger traffic in the U.S. may also reflect its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak">horrendous rail system</a>.</p>

<p><em>See also John Cowan&#8217;s comment below, for a different (personal) interpretation of Google&#8217;s terms of service.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Google Maps won&#8217;t show me satellite imagery this morning.</p>
<p>Google has recently set up a system to try to autodetect and block bots scraping their system, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google_Web_Search_Help-Troubleshooting/browse_frm/thread/2ec0b8abccca19e4">it isn&#8217;t working very well</a> — people are getting blocked even from Google Search simply because they have too many (human-generated) queries passing through the same proxy.</p>
<p>This morning, I suddenly discovered a different problem: the satellite view in Google Maps has stopped working for me — I get the &#8220;don&#8217;t have imagery at this zoom level for this region&#8221; error everywhere, at every zoom level.  I can still see maps and terrain, but not satellite pics, and I noticed the host <code>sorry.google.com</code> setting a lot of cookies.</p>
<p>Is Google&#8217;s satellite imagery down for everyone else this morning, or has their software decided that I&#8217;m a bot trying to scrape satellite imagery?</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>I was right — Google&#8217;s software had decided that I was a bot.  They have a test link directly to a satellite to see if you&#8217;re being blocked:</p>
<p><a href="http://khm0.google.com/kh?v=31&amp;hl=en&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;z=1&amp;s=">http://khm0.google.com/kh?v=31&amp;hl=en&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;z=1&amp;s=</a></p>
<p>It took me to <a href="http://sorry.google.com/sorry/?continue=http://khm0.google.com/kh%3Fv%3D31%26hl%3Den%26x%3D0%26y%3D0%26z%3D1%26s%3D">this page</a>.  I was able to renable access simply by entering a CAPTCHA.</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>I wrote a couple of months ago about <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2008/07/27/detecting-overzoom-in-google-maps/">how to detect overzoom in Google Maps</a>.  My guess is that the overzoom protection in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> — automatically zooming out every 4 seconds until there were actual satellite tiles available — triggered to bot alert, and I&#8217;ve disabled the feature for now.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very bad news for any mashup that uses JavaScript to do more sophisticated things with Google Maps, like, say, panning at regular intervals.  Google&#8217;s bot detection seems to be extremely naive, and any repeated action at regular intervals will fire it off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>[Warning: as of 1 October 2008, Google is using an over-simplistic bot detection algorithm, and something as simple as zooming out at regular intervals can trigger it and temporarily block access to Google resources.  I recommend waiting until they fix their algorithms to use this technique.]</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a link to a web page showing how to <a href="http://esa.ilmari.googlepages.com/sorry.htm">detect overzoom</a> with the Google Maps API.</p>
<p>Overzoom is a big issue for my site <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a>, which shows a close-up satellite view on each airport&#8217;s page (e.g. the former <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/KCGX/">Meigs Field</a>).  Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no documented way to use the Google Maps API to check if a satellite view is overzoomed (instead of a satellite picture, it&#8217;s showing the &#8220;We are sorry, but we don&#8217;t have imagery at this zoom level for this region&#8230;&#8221; message).  That can be confusing for someone who isn&#8217;t a regular Google Maps user and hasn&#8217;t actually touched the zoom controls on the map.</p>
<div id="hack">
<h2>The hack</h2>
<p>The page above came up with the clever solution of counting paragraphs in the map container.  If there is a &#8220;sorry&#8221; message, there will be HTML <code>p</code> elements inside the map container.  Here&#8217;s a simple JavaScript function that checks to see if the map is overzoomed, and zooms out one level if it is:</p>
<pre>function check_zoom (map)
{
    var zoom = map.getZoom();
    var count = map.getContainer().getElementsByTagName('p').length;

    if (zoom &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; count &gt; 0) {
        map.setZoom(zoom - 1);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Note that it doesn&#8217;t iterate — it just does one check and exits.  The easiest way to use this is just to have it run every two seconds or so.  If your map is available in a variable named <var>map</var>, this will do the trick:</p>
<pre>setInterval("check_zoom(map)", 2000);</pre>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>To see how it works, check out <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/EFVU/">Vuotso Airport</a> in Finland.  Google Maps doesn&#8217;t have very good satellite coverage for Lapland in the far north, but OurAirports now detects that after a couple of seconds and zooms out one step.  For a more extreme example, look at <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYLT/">Alert Airport</a>, the world&#8217;s northernmost permanent airport, in Nunavut, Canada — the code has to zoom out several times until you can see anything in the satellite view.</p>
</div>
<div id="caveats">
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>The more elegant solution would be to detect when the map is finished loading after every event that can affect it, but that sounds like too much work to save a couple of milliseconds here and there.</p>
<p>Note that Google can break this at any time simply by adding or removing <var>p</var> elements — it would be much better to have an official, reliable way to detect when a satellite view is overzoomed.</p>
</div>
