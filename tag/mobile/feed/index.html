										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2013/07/17/transitioning-to-a-mobile-centric-world/">http://abovethecrowd.com/2013/07/17/transitioning-to-a-mobile-centric-world/</a></p>
<p>This article argues that the verdict is in, and users want apps, not mobile web sites.&nbsp; My friend and colleague Michael Roberts (who, I suspect, is neutral in the debate) shared this link on Google+, and &#8211; as if to prove Mr Gurley&#8217;s thesis &#8211; I read his posting in the Android G+ app, not the mobile site.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here is the comment I left:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interesting piece &#8211; thanks, Michael . He&#8217;s absolutely right that people prefer apps to the browser for common tasks, but I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s got the whole story.&nbsp; For example, like most people, I currently read G+, Facebook, and Twitter in the dedicated mobile apps rather than in the browser.&nbsp; However, a large plurality (if not majority) of interesting posts to those services are actually links back out into the web, so the result of of reading a tweet is generally opening not a dedicated app, but a web site.</p>
<p>Case in point &#8211; we&#8217;re both reacting to a pro-app/anti-browser article, but the only reason we know about it is that you were able to share a web link in your G+ post.&nbsp; If Mr. Gurley had created a &#8220;GurleyPosts&#8221; app for his thoughts, then (a) most people probably wouldn&#8217;t have it installed, and (b) you wouldn&#8217;t have been able to pass a link from iOS that I could use to read it on Android.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, for something I do a lot (read Facebook, check the weather, play a game, get driving directions) I will tend to use an app.&nbsp; But I <em>won&#8217;t </em>install a dedicated app just to read an article from a magazine or newspaper, and even when I am using an app, I need a <u>link</u> if I&#8217;m going to share it with anyone else.</p>
<p>So in 2013 for mobile, apps are for the tall head of any user&#8217;s activities, and the browser is for the long tail.&nbsp; Of course, every startup thinks it&#8217;s going to be the next Facebook (at least in terms of its importance to the people who use it), but few of them end up there, so the way people are going to find them is by following links from FB, Twitter, Google+, emails, chats, etc.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t give up on that mobile web site quite yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bit over a week ago, I set myself a challenge: develop a mobile app <em>entirely using mobile devices.</em> I must never touch the app with a laptop or desktop computer, for even the most-trivial reason.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a lot of free time in my life, so I&#8217;ve been able to tinker for only an hour here or there, but so far, I&#8217;ve had good success.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>
<p>Here are the ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Android OS (Jellybean) running on a Nexus 7 tablet, with a small Bluetooth keyboard</li>
<li>the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui">Android Integrated Development</a> (AIDE) app, which uses the Eclipse project format and includes a git client</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, for storing my source code</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Progress and gotchas</strong></p>
<p>I decided to create a kind of app that made sense as a mobile app (rather than a web site): a SQL query tool for databases on the device.&nbsp; I&#8217;m calling it &#8220;Sloop-SQL&#8221;, and while my early prototype isn&#8217;t in the Play Store yet, you can grab the Public Domain source from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/davidmegginson/sloop-sql">https://github.com/davidmegginson/sloop-sql</a> and build your own copy with AIDE on your phone/tablet or Eclipse on your laptop/desktop.</p>
<p>The process has worked surprisingly well so far. When I want to test on my phone (rather than my tablet), it takes only a few seconds to do a git pull on the phone, and build and run using AIDE.&nbsp; I also enjoy the simpler AIDE UI over the cluttered Eclipse one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve run into only two significant annoyances:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub doesn&#8217;t have a mobile-friendly site, and their mobile app is severely limited, so it was a bit frustrating creating the repository.</li>
<li>As of Jellybean, Android doesn&#8217;t let apps request permission to see other apps&#8217; logs, so AIDE can&#8217;t show me the app&#8217;s logcat (which includes crash reports from uncaught, top-level exceptions).</li>
</ol>
<p>I could work around the second problem by rooting my N7, but that&#8217;s also cheating. </p>
<p>I hope that the Android team will consider adding the read-logs permission back in &#8212; perhaps backed by a special developer setting &#8212; so that Android can grow into a full software development environment, rather than being nothing more than a development target (like iOS).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I installed the Google Chat Voice plugin today, and found that I was able to make free Google Voice calls from Canada to both a US and a Canadian POTS number.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I installed the <a href="http://www.google.com/chat/voice/">Google Chat Voice</a> plugin today, and found that I was able to make free Google Voice calls from Canada to both a US and a Canadian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service">POTS</a> number.  I&#8217;m still unable to register for Google Voice at <a href="http://www.google.com/voice/">google.com/voice</a>, and I cannot use the Google Voice app on my Android phone, but at least I can initiate a call from inside GMail on my laptop now.</p>
<p>Does this mean that Google is about to roll out full Google Voice support for Canada, or just that they forgot to plug a hole in the code that that&#8217;s supposed to prevent non-US accounts from using the service?  </p>
<p>Google Voice on my Android phone would be fantastic, because I could make unlimited North American phone calls on (say) a 6 GB, $30/month data plan instead of paying the <a href="http://wirelessnorth.ca/2010/08/27/its-2010-and-canadians-pay-the-highest-cell-phone-bills-in-the-world/">world&#8217;s highest cell phone bills</a> for (limited) voice and long distance.  I&#8217;m sure <a href="http://www.rogers.com">Rogers</a> and other mobile carriers won&#8217;t be happy about that, but I hope their lobbyists can&#8217;t stop it.</p>

<strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile web users&#8217; needs differ by more than UI features (small touch screen): they may check information more often, and expect it to be fresher.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Last night, I finally got around to installing Google Analytics on <a href="http://ourairports.mobi/">ourairports.mobi</a>, the mobile version (for pre-smartphones) of <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">ourairports.com</a>, and this morning, I got my first stats: all of <strong>3</strong> visits yesterday (vs. 1,677 for the non-mobile site).</p>
<p>I expect that number to climb when the site is collecting stats for a complete 24-hour day, but already, I&#8217;ve noticed a significant difference in use:</p>
<table>
<col align="left"></col>
<col align="right"></col>
<col align="right"></col>
<col align="right"></col>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Site</th>
<th>Visits</th>
<th>Page views</th>
<th>Pages/visit</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mobile</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">3</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">93</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">31.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Desktop</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">1,677</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">4,748</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">2.83</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Of course, the mobile sample is too small to be statistically significant, but it still made me think about how a mobile user will use the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>A desktop user at home may check information for an airport once while planning a flight (as pilot or airline passenger).</li>
<li>A mobile user, at or on the way to the airport, will keep checking for changes (new weather forecast, NOTAMs, etc.), constantly updating the same few pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>A closer look at the analytics confirms that hypothesis, with a small number of airports updated multiple times (there were four pageviews for <a href="http://ourairports.mobi/airports/YPEF/">Sunbury Airfield</a> in Australia, for example).</p>
<p><strong>Further hypothesis:</strong> timely data is important for all web users, but it may be disproportionately important for mobile users.  If this is true, it&#8217;s probably worth spending less time trying to make your mobile site (or app) look like a fourth-year graphic design college project, and more time making sure that it has the best, and most recent information.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll watch the analytics for ourairports.mobi over the next month to see if this trend continues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Lord Byron" src="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lord-byron1.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></p>
<p>So what happened last week?  Did Google <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/opinion/08cringeley.html">backtrack after getting caught trying to be evil</a> about net neutrality and the mobile internet, or were they a <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Government-IT/The-Truth-About-Google-Verizon-and-Net-Neutrality-371606/">victim of a misunderstanding</a> (gleefully amplified by blood-thirsty Apple and RIM supporters)?</p>
<p><strong>Net neutrality</strong> is a crucial issue for those of us who care about open information.  We believe that the Internet is a public thoroughfare, where every information provider has the same access.  Competing web sites shouldn&#8217;t have their traffic slowed down because Google or Microsoft paid more money to Verizon, Rogers, or Bell, any more than you should have to pull to the side of the road to let someone in a more expensive car pass you.</p>
<h3>Carriers in search of a business plan</h3>
<p>For obvious reasons, the Internet providers don&#8217;t see it that way. They&#8217;ve ended up stuck in the rut of commodity service, with the inevitable race to the bottom for price, and are desperate to find some new revenue.  The mobile Internet providers are a little better off because they can at least lock customers into three-year contracts by giving them subsidized smartphones, but it&#8217;s still clear that someone like Verizon would be thrilled be able to take a big bag of money from Google in exchange for letting Google sites load a little faster than anyone else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that that&#8217;s not what Google was trying to do.</p>
<h3>Neutral in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">what sense</span>?</h3>
<p>The Google-Verizon kerfuffle draws attention to a different, and trickier part of the debate.  What if, instead of discriminating by provider (Google vs Facebook), carriers discriminated by traffic <em>type</em>? In other words, what if streaming audio and video got priority handling to avoid jerky playback, while e-mail was delayed an extra 2-4 seconds? All streaming video would get the same treatment, whether it comes from YouTube or a student&#8217;s dorm-room start-up, and all e-mail would get the same treatment, whether it&#8217;s from IBM or a LOL cats fan list.</p>
<p>According to Google&#8217;s CEO, Eric Schmidt, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/fcc-on-net-neutrality-yes-we-can.ars">this is what Verizon and Google were talking about all along</a>: not favouring one provider over another, but favouring one <em>content type</em> over another.</p>
<h3>Is it still evil?</h3>
<p>I expect that many people who support net neutrality for providers won&#8217;t feel so strongly about net neutrality for content types, because it doesn&#8217;t have the same appearance of unfairness.</p>
<p>Going back to the thoroughfare analogy, we have sidewalks where only pedestrians are allowed, paths where only cyclists are allowed, crossings that pedestrians aren&#8217;t allowed to use, and superhighways where only motor vehicles are allowed.  Buses and carpoolers are sometimes allowed to use a faster lane, trucks are sometimes required to stay in the slower lanes, and so on.  Why can&#8217;t we have different lanes for different kinds of network traffic, too?</p>
<h3>Net neutrality makes sense for content types, too</h3>
<p>There are, however, four compelling arguments in favour of net neutrality by content type as well as provider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pandora&#8217;s Box</strong> — it seems straight-forward enough to give streaming video priority over email, but how far might carriers take it?  Will carriers throttle IM during the next G8 summit to make it harder for protesters to organize?  Will government regulators prefer content types that are more popular among the old than the young?</li>
<li><strong>Business/content-type alignment</strong> — as the owner of the world&#8217;s top video site, Google has a strong interest in making video on the mobile web faster, even if it means that its competitors&#8217; videos are faster too. This kind of thing could turn evil fast — imagine Adobe and Apple in a bidding war to determine whether Flash should be delivered faster or slower than other content types, or the recording industry lobbying to throttle bittorrent so much that it becomes useless.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong> — the Internet already existed when HTML and HTTP arrived on the scene 20 years ago.  If the net hadn&#8217;t been neutral then, perhaps priority would have gone to important existing protocols like telnet and FTP, and HTTP (and HTML) might have been slow enough to turn off early adopters.  We don&#8217;t know what The Next Big Thing will be, but we do know that regulators respond slowly to change.  Why shut the door on innovation?</li>
<li><strong>Routing around censorship</strong> — seriously, how long will it take a few enterprising developers to realize that they can build an &#8220;accelerated download&#8221; app that allows other traffic to masquerade as video (or whatever has top priority).  Seconds?  Less?  You can make anything look like anything else on the Internet, and everyone thinks that his/her traffic is most important.</li>
</ol>
<h3>It&#8217;s OK to be wrong sometimes</h3>
<p>Google is a company that <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/08/failure-is-always-option-at-google.html">embraces failure</a>, which, perhaps, is why it has so many successes: Google puts products out early, lets us play with them, then feeds the ones that succeed (e.g. Gmail) and kills the ones that don&#8217;t (e.g. Wave).</p>
<p>Perhaps Google is willing to try the same thing with ideas — they&#8217;re not necessarily evil for suggesting dropping net neutrality for content types, but they <em>are</em> wrong.  Let&#8217;s treat the whole thing as a failed project and move on, concentrating on making the net (mobile or desktop) faster for all providers, and all content types.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had a few weeks to play with my <a href="http://www.google.com/phone">Nexus One</a>, I&#8217;m starting to grok the gut-level experience of living with a smart phone.  I understand why people download apps, how it feels to have the Internet with me everywhere, and what it&#8217;s like to experience the web by touch on a screen that&#8217;s only a few centimetres square.</p>
<h3 id="past">Past</h3>
<p>Device-specific apps are sweet and shiny at first, but after a couple of weeks, it becomes obvious that many of them are the encore of the floppy-based PC shareware world of the 1980s and early 1990s (<span style="color:green;">SEND $5 TO GET RID OF THE ANNOYING ADS!</span> <span style="color:red;">ONLY $10 FOR THE FULL VERSION!</span>).</p>
<p>Discovering an interesting app through Apple&#8217;s or Android&#8217;s market (or taking a picture of a barcode on your computer screen) is surprisingly awkward compared to just following a link from one web site to another, and as we&#8217;ve learned from the postal service, the telegraph, the telephone, email, and the web, connectivity always wins in the end.</p>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>Web apps run everywhere and connect to each-other seamlessly, and HTML5 allows a well-written web app to do <em>almost</em> everything a closed, device-specific app can do on a smart phone — many of the mobile web sites I&#8217;ve used (hello, <a href="http://m.google.com/">Google</a>!) are as good as or better than the corresponding device-specific apps.  There are some things, though, that make mobile web apps stand apart:</p>
<ul>
<li>The built-in buttons on your smartphone are tied to the browser, not to the app, so the Android menu or search button (for example) brings up a browser menu or search box, not an app one.</li>
<li>For good security reasons, a web app will probably never have as much access to the filesystem and device hardware as a closed device-specific app (do you want a malicious web app to be able to turn on your video camera when you&#8217;re browsing in bed?  do you ever consider that when you give a downloaded app access to your camera?).</li>
<li>While HTML5 supports notifications, you have to actually be on the web page to receive them.  That can be fixed by allowing the browser to launch web pages automatically on start/restart, but it&#8217;s still more awkward than an autostart app.</li>
<li>Web app processes need to be managed from inside the browser, not from a device-wide process manager.</li>
<li>As far as I know, there&#8217;s no way for a web app to install its own icon on the device home screen &#8212; the user has to install it manually (though it&#8217;s pretty easy).</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t consider most of these to be a big deal, but they do point to the fact that no matter how much extra functionality HTML5 provides, web apps have a different world view: they&#8217;re nodes in a huge network, not standalone silos.</p>
<h3 id="present">Present</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably have to continue to use a device-specific app for anything related to playing music or capturing photos/video for a while longer, and I&#8217;ll hang onto the Android WiFi analyzer I&#8217;m running on my phone.  Android has a lot of the same apps that show up in iPhone commercials (like <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/">Urban Spoon</a>), but while they&#8217;re pretty, they&#8217;re limited in the end — there&#8217;s way more out there on the web than there will ever be an an app store.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an person or organization that wants to interact with people on mobile devices, you have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can develop and maintain separate apps for iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Palm, and any other smart-phone OS&#8217;s that may come along, and let the phone vendors be gatekeepers between you and your users.</li>
<li>You can run a single mobile web app on your own server, one that&#8217;s only a click away from any other web site that links to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first option lets you force an icon onto the users desktop, but the direct development costs and opportunity costs of losing inbound links and search-engine love just seem too high.</p>

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;font-size:smaller;color:#444444;"><p>I left this comment on Simon St-Laurent&#8217;s interesting and thoughtful post <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/01/how-dare-apple.html">How dare Apple &#8230;</a> (which, in turn, was partly a response to Tim Bray&#8217;s post <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/27/iPad">Nothing Creative</a>).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that most things, including the iPad, are obviously right or wrong, but I do have serious concerns that go beyond simply not being able to code on an iPad (at least, until <em>there&#8217;s an app for that</em>).  I&#8217;m copying my comment here to give it a more permanent home.  If I hadn&#8217;t posted this yet, I&#8217;d edit it to tone down the emotional language 10% or so, but still, it&#8217;s a fair reflection of my thoughts and concerns, not about the iPad itself (it&#8217;s just another consumer device), but about the way people are starting to talk and think about issues that are very important to me, like software freedom:</p></blockquote>
<p>The thing about creativity is that it responds poorly to central planning and central control. I have no problem with the fact that the iPad isn&#8217;t developer-friendly &#8212; I can buy a Netbook with twice the power for half the price and code on it (and, BTW, that netbook makes just as simple a consumer device).</p>
<p>My problem is the idea that a single Apple politburo controls everything that can appear on the device. Is that the future? Even in the bad old days of TV, before cable, there were 3 1/2 US networks to choose from, not just one &#8211; you had to watch TV outside the US to see just how bad things could get with a single, government-controlled broadcaster (I grew up in Canada, but close enough to watch the US stations, thank god).</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s obsession with central control goes beyond software to hardware. There must be some kind of port for the optional keyboard to plug into, but no way it&#8217;s going to be USB or Firewire, because that might let someone use an *unplanned* creative device on the iPad, someone creative daring not to give Apple its cut (and veto). If I build something clever for creative people using a USB interface, it will work with desktop towers, notebooks, netbooks, and even some small portable devices, but *not* with the iPad.</p>
<p>Apple has some smart people working there, but they won&#8217;t always have the best ideas, and Apple has thrown up too many barriers to other people with smart ideas. The best apps in the future are going to come from a couple of students coding in a dorm room, and they might just be so annoyed by Apple censorship that they defect to a freer platform. It&#8217;s sad that things have gotten to the point that even Windows is a freer platform than Apple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my university studies, I first encountered the idea of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Progress">Myth of Progress</a> — in 19th and 20th centuries a lot of people assumed that the world generally gets better each generation (aside from occasional blips like depressions or world wars), with less bigotry, better medicine, new technology, etc., but there&#8217;s no guarantee that any next generation will build on and improve the accomplishments of the previous one, and history&#8217;s movement may be more akin to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Case in point:</strong> in the information technology world, the greatest accomplishment of the most talented coders and business people in GenX was replacing the Baby Boomers&#8217; nasty old platform-dependent shrink-wrapped computer applications with open web applications that could run anywhere, from a Windows desktop to a Linux cell phone.  Write once, run all over the place on any hardware/OS you want.  GMail instead of Eudora.  Wikipedia instead of Encarta.  Cool, eh?</p>
<p><strong>So GenY comes along</strong> and says &#8220;hey: instead of encouraging people to browse the web with open standards, let&#8217;s build proprietary applications that run on only one type of mobile phone.  And we&#8217;ll allow only <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">one store</a></strong> to sell those applications for each type of phone, and every proprietary, platform-specific app will have to be preapproved and precensored by the phone manufacturer, who will extort^H^H^H^H^H^H be gladly offered a cut of sales.&#8221;  Even Microsoft in its monopolistic hey-day — before it became the toothless lion it is today — never had the balls to try anything like that with Windows apps.</p>
<p><strong>Who, ten years ago</strong>, would have predicted an IT catastrophe like this after so much progress and hope? It&#8217;s enough to make a person cry.  Let&#8217;s encourage those GenY&#8217;ers who taken up the torch and continue to work on the dream of an open web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working on <a href="http://ourairports.mobi">ourairports.mobi</a>, the mobile version of <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a>, I&#8217;m getting a crash course in writing for mobile browsers.  Here, in no particular order, are some of my lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The OpenWave browser is horrendous, ignoring character encoding, randomly skipping some simple CSS, etc., but it&#8217;s one of the most common on small cell phones, so you have to live with it.</li>
<li>Some Nokia browsers will accept a 302 redirect but consider a 303 to be an HTTP error.</li>
<li>Cell phone browsers all seem to display the <var>title</var> element at the top of the screen, so if you have the same text in <var>title</var> and <var>h1</var>, it will appear twice, probably filling the whole first page.  If I leave it out, though, what happens on bigger screens like the iPhone or Blackberry?</li>
<li>Breadcrumbs are a bad idea for mobile pages, because they use a lot of screen real-estate on a cell phone.  I might move mine to the bottom.</li>
<li>Making too many things into links is a bad idea, because it takes a long time to scroll though them.</li>
<li>Even small graphics take a <em>long</em> time to load.  If there&#8217;s no good reason, don&#8217;t make people download any.  Including your corporate logo is not a good reason.  Use colors instead of graphics when you can.</li>
<li>OpenWave (and, I assume, other browsers) do not choose intelligent default font sizes for <var>h1</var>, etc. — they&#8217;ll fill the whole screen if you don&#8217;t change them with CSS.</li>
<li>When only a couple of dozen words fit on a screen at once, verbosity is a bad thing.  Ask yourself &#8220;can I say it with fewer words&#8221;?  Then do the same thing four or five times more. I&#8217;m still working on that.</li>
<li>Short previews are a good idea for things like comment lists, to save scrolling time.  Leave out as much as possible (for example, I don&#8217;t give the date of a comment unless the user views the full comment).</li>
<li><strong>Always</strong> including &#8220;jump to&#8221; links at the top of every page to save scrolling.</li>
<li>Extra stuff you&#8217;d normally put at the top of a web page, like a search box, login info, home link, etc., belongs at the <em>bottom</em> of a mobile web page, so that users don&#8217;t have to scroll past it to get to the content.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll add more as I discover it.</p>
