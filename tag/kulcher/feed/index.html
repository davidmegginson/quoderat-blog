										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Canada, people who have served time for a wrongful murder conviction become famous &mdash; <em>very</em> famous &mdash; and stay that way for years and decades.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Truscott">Steven Truscott</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Marshall,_Jr.">Donald Marshall Jr.</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Milgaard">David Milgaard</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Paul_Morin">Guy Paul Morin</a> are arguably household names, better known than many celebrities (including most medal-winning Canadian Olympic athletes, award-winning musicians, etc.)</p>
<p>Truscott&#8217;s initial wrongful conviction took place 40 years ago, but if anything, he&#8217;s better known now than any time before.  Three men with more recentky-overturned convictions &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baltovich">Robert Baltovich</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mullins-Johnson">Bill Mullins-Johnson</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Driskell">James Driskell</a> &mdash; are also getting on-going press coverage, TV documentaries, etc.</p>
<p>I had never thought anything unusual about this phenomenon, until the Mullins-Johnson article was suddenly deleted from Wikipedia, with no debate &mdash; the Wikipedia editor had assumed that a wrongful conviction was so obviously unnotable that no discussion was required, but when I objected, he did restore the article and start a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bill_Mullins-Johnson">proper RFD debate</a>.</p>
<p>When Wikipedia has articles about minor, imaginary videogame characters, it seemed unimaginable to me at first that editors would try to delete an article about a real, famous person, but so far, there seems little support for keeping the article.  Thinking about it, I suddenly realized that the wrongfully-convicted <em>aren&#8217;t</em> famous in the U.S.  Sure, I could Google around and find a few names, but in the U.S., serving 10 years for a murder you didn&#8217;t commit does not automatically make you a household name &mdash; in fact, it might not even result in a national news story.</p>
<p>Perhaps there&#8217;s a strong feeling of discomfort around the issue in a country that still executes so many of its citizens.  Or perhaps, because the wrongly-convicted often have prior criminal records, Americans don&#8217;t feel that their convictions were such a serious injustice.  Many U.S. jurisdictions (all?) have very small limits on the compensation you can receive for a wrongful conviction, while in Canada, someone who has been in jail for years could receive well over $1M &mdash; a big news story in itself.</p>
<p>I have a conflict of interest with the RFD for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mullins-Johnson">Bill Mullins-Johnson</a> article because I was the original author (though many others have since contributed), but if the article is going to be deleted, I&#8217;d hate it to be simply from lack of debate.  So, Wikipedia users, whether you agree or disagree with me, please visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bill_Mullins-Johnson">RFD page</a> and have your say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Megginson">Wikipedia article about me</a> was vandalized yesterday (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Megginson&amp;oldid=186215680">vandalized version</a>) by someone from the IP address <a href="http://ws.arin.net/whois/?queryinput=24.225.66.95">24.225.66.95</a>, which seems to be in or near Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<ol>
<li><del>Edit the article myself to remove the vandalism?</del> &mdash; OK, that&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/12/69880">really bad idea</a></li>
<li><del>Go in anonymously and edit the article?</del> &mdash; also a <a href="http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/">bad idea</a></li>
<li>Rejoice in the fact that my article is important enough to be vandalized?</li>
<li>Despair in the fact that my article is not important enough for anyone else to have noticed and fixed it?</li>
<li>Reconcile myself to the idea that the edits are not vandalism at all, and I am, in truth, &#8220;a freaking looser who knows nothing&#8221; and &#8220;a noob&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m leaning towards #5, though I&#8217;m disappointed that kids these days seem to have forgotten how to swear properly: &#8220;a <em>freaking</em> loser&#8221;???</p>

</div>
<p>Almost a year ago, I wrote that <a href="/blogs/quoderat/2007/03/28/open-data-matters-more-than-open-source/">Open data matters more than Open Source</a> &mdash; it doesn&#8217;t matter (to you, the end user) whether a web site is using Open Source software or not, if they still keep your data locked up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a nasty example: Robert Scoble has just <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/01/03/ive-been-kicked-off-of-facebook/">had his Facebook account disabled</a> for running a script to try to scrape his personal information off the site (since Facebook doesn&#8217;t provide him with any other way to get it).</p>
<p>I understand that Facebook needs to protect against malicious bots &mdash; and they might decide to restore his account once they know what Robert was actually trying to do (though for now all traces of him have vanished) &mdash; but do we really want to have hope for the good will of social sites and beg for our own data every time we want it?  Are web site owners the new version of the Proprietors in the early American colonies, who can grant rights as favours when they see fit?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em><strong>Update:</strong> I read that the school concert went ahead, with <cite>Frosty the Snowman</cite> replacing the modified <cite>Silver Bells</cite> as the token non-religious song on the programme (<cite>Frosty</cite> makes no reference to any religious holidays).</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Both of my children attended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmdale_Public_School">Elmdale Public School</a> here in Ottawa from junior kindergarten to grade six.  Now, my kids&#8217; alma mater has triggered a <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=184731">nation-wide moral panic</a> by changing the line &#8220;it&#8217;s Christmas time in the city&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;s <em>festive</em> time in the city&#8221; in the song <cite>Silver Bells</cite> for a grade-two and -three concert.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already gone on record saying that <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2006/12/22/its-ok-to-wish-me-merry-christmas/">it&#8217;s OK to wish me Merry Christmas</a> &mdash; I&#8217;m as proud of my Christian background as some of my friends and neighbours are of their Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu backgrounds &mdash; but that&#8217;s not what this was all about.  The primary choir was already singing songs about Christmas and Hanukkah, and the choir leaders decided to add <em>an additional</em> song that was non-religious.  I think that the existing non-religious songs <cite>Jingle Bells</cite> or <cite>Winter Wonderland</cite> would have been fine, but they decided to take <cite>Silver Bells</cite> &mdash; an otherwise secular pop song about shopping downtown in a city &mdash; and replace the word &#8220;Christmas&#8221;.  Silly?  Probably.  An attack on Christmas or Christianity?  Hardly.</p>
<div>
<h3>The <em>real</em> attack on Christmas and Christianity</h3>
<p>Here are some people who might need help understanding the idea of Christmas and Christianity:</p>
<ul>
<li>the school parent(s) who decided to take this to the media</li>
<li>the newspaper columnists who made a primary class holiday concert into a national culture battle</li>
<li>the talk radio hosts who urged listeners to go after the school and ended up putting the lives of hundreds of small children at risk</li>
<li>the hundreds of people who called or e-mail messages of hatred (and a bomb threat) to the nice women working in the school office</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Christian New Testament, Jesus didn&#8217;t have anything good to say about people like this &mdash; he far preferred the company of prostitutes and tax collectors to the religious self-righteous.  If you are religious (any religion), pray, meditate, or just hope that their hearts can still be opened this season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> the site shopping cart is broken, and doesn&#8217;t properly remove items from the total owing &mdash; too bad.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.megginson.com/img/dg_logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one easy way: <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/26/drm-free-classical-music-deutsche-grammophon-launches-online-mp3-store/">via TechCrunch</a>, Deutsche Grammophon, the gold standard in renaissance/ baroque/ classical/ romantic/ orchestral/ opera/ etc. music (often confusingly referred to collectively as &ldquo;classical&rdquo;, roughly equivalent calling all popular music since 1890 &ldquo;rap&rdquo;), will start selling their catalogue as unprotected MP3s at midnight German time tonight (6:00 pm in New York City) at their new site <a href="http://www.dgwebshop.com/">dgwebshop.com</a>.</p>
<p>As a teenager in the late 1970s, I used to visit the <cite>House of Sound</cite> in Kingston (Canada), where they had thousands of DG records &mdash; probably most of the catalogue &mdash; packed in tight on on shelves lining a wall of the store.  I couldn&#8217;t always afford them, but I loved being able just to pull them out and take a look at the covers of the different famous recordings.  These days, the so-called classical music section of any but a couple of specialized stores in big cities like New York or London have maybe one or two rows of worthless classical-pop compilations hidden behind the DVDs of TV series nobody watched in the 1980s &mdash; no wonder people don&#8217;t shop at record stores any more.</p>
<p>We tech types have been claiming for a while that music companies could make more money selling unprotected digital music, so here&#8217;s the test.  I plan to give them a lot of my own money if the site actually works, though I should note a couple of caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many current DG buyers are audiophiles who won&#8217;t be satisfied with the sound quality of MP3s (which are optimized more for boom-boom music), so this will probably open a new market for DG rather than leaching their current one.</li>
<li>DG&#8217;s market is mostly affulent people outside the intense social environment of high school or university, so people will be less likely to share these MP3s &mdash; and even if they do, it will probably just act as a promo for the higher quality recordings.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope the site can handle the traffic.  Rock on, Deutsche Grammophon!</p>

<p>Gunner <strong>William Henry Ranson</strong> (born 1843) has started a blog about his life in the ranks of Royal Artillery and as a civilian in Canada right after Confederation:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code><a href="http://whranson.blogspot.com/">http://whranson.blogspot.com/</a></code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Gunner Ranson was my great-great-grandfather.  After serving in the Royal Artillery during the 1860s, he ended up settling in Canada permanently in the 1870s.  While many British officers kept diaries and wrote memoirs, very few men of the ranks did &mdash; although a good number could read and write, few had the inclination and the available time (and light) to do so &mdash; but my great-great-grandfather was an exception.  While we don&#8217;t have the original diary, we do have a summary that he wrote later in life as a memoir, based on the lost diary, giving a working man&#8217;s view of both the British military and of later civilian life (often more brutal) in Victorian Canada.</p>
<p>My brother Tom has had the memoir for some years and has been trying to decide the best way to edit and publish it.  In the end, he has decided to publish sections serially as a blog.  I encourage anyone interested in British or Canadian history to read this.  The blog format reminds me very strongly of the serial magazine publication common during the Victorian period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em><strong>Summary:</strong> Perhaps the women who don&#8217;t choose computer programming are making a good choice, especially with the deteriorating working conditions, stagnant or falling salaries, and offshoring.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, we&#8217;ve had a few postings about women in computing (or the lack thereof) — see <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/14/DevChix">Bray</a>, <a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/archives/2007/06/14/tech-women/">Wood</a>, <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/30">Tenison</a>, and <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/20/Women">Bray (again)</a>, all ignited by a <a href="http://www.devchix.com/2007/06/09/let%e2%80%99s-all-evolve-past-this-the-barriers-women-face-in-tech-communities/">piece in devChix</a>.</p>
<p>These postings all assume that we need to <em>do something</em> to pull more women into coding.  Why?  Do we think there are there lots of women would be happy coding, but aren&#8217;t smart enough or motivated enough to choose the right careers for themselves, or are too timid to deal with any barriers unless someone comes along and dismantles them first?</p>
<div id="market">
<h3>Listen to the market</h3>
<p>In an age where we&#8217;ve come to trust central planning less and the free market more, why not try to learn from the labour market instead of trying to push it ways it doesn&#8217;t want to go?</p>
<p>If we assume that the majority of working women <em>are</em> smart, strong, motivated, and brave, then we can also assume that they have good reasons for choosing their careers.  And in fact, it turns out that their track record isn&#8217;t bad.  For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, women were grossly underrepresented in manufacturing and overrepresented in lower-paying service-industry jobs like retail.  But when manufacturing starting offshoring in the 1980s and 1990s, it was the women who were still working (often as managers, at this point), while the men were at home, depressed, collecting welfare cheques or trying to retrain for jobs that paid a fraction of what they used to earn.</p>
<p>Now, while there&#8217;s lots of work connected with tech, we see pure coding increasingly being offshored, the same way that manufacturing was 20 years ago.  There&#8217;s no shortage of women working in jobs connected with computers, but instead of coding, many women choose onsite consulting, training, marketing, and other jobs that are not only social but require face time with customers, and as a result, are much more difficult to offshore.</p>
<p>Of course, if you absolutely love coding, like I do (and most of the people reading this do), you&#8217;re going to work hard to try to find a way to keep doing it, whether you&#8217;re a man or a woman.  But if you don&#8217;t feel that burning love, why let yourself be dragged kicking and screaming into an industry where salaries are falling, jobs are fleeing, hours are increasing (bye bye weekends!), and workers are increasingly treated as interchangeable cogs on a development assembly line, without even the (questionable) union protection their parents had in their factory jobs 20-30 years ago?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dare Obasanjo just put up a posting with the title <cite><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=69141977-7514-443d-800b-1f95c1ff8dbe">Open Source is Dead</a></cite>.  Dare does happen to be a Microsoft employee, but his posting is none of the standard anti-Linux/OpenOffice/Apache/Firefox FUD.  Instead, he voices a question that&#8217;s been floating around for a while:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; how much value do you think there is to be had from a snapshot of the source code for eBay or Facebook being made available? This is one area where Open Source offers no solution to the problem of vendor lock-in.
</p></blockquote>
<div id="locked">
<h3>Let me out!!!</h3>
<p>In other words, as the Web replaces Microsoft Windows as the world&#8217;s favorite desktop/laptop software platform (it may be there already), what good is Open Source to ordinary computer user? Even if a web site happens to be built on Open Source software (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a> stack), I&#8217;m still locked in:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I move my address book and archived e-mail from Hotmail to Yahoo or GMail?</li>
<li>How can I move my blog (with all postings and comments) from Blogger to Bloglines or WordPress?</li>
<li>How can someone move her contact list and comments from MySpace to Facebook?</li>
<li>How can a buyer in Yahoo&#8217;s auction thingy verify my reputation on eBay?</li>
<li>How can I move my old flight plans from Aeroplanner to FBOWeb?</li>
<li>How can I move my sales contacts and data from Salesforce.com to Highrise?</li>
<li>How can I move my pictures <em>with their tags</em> from Flickr to Smugmug?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="open">
<h3>A crack of light under the door</h3>
<p>These are huge problems, and the solution is probably going to have a lot more to do with <strong>Open Data</strong> than with Open Source.  There are already a couple of minor successes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog reading sites almost universally support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> import and export, so that you can save the list of blogs you read from one site and move it to another.</li>
<li>Online wordprocessors and spreadsheets, of course, support the Microsoft Office formats and/or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a> formats and/or RTF and CSV. </li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s not much, though.  Open Source (and its predecessor buzzword, <em>Free Software</em>) have been very important over the past couple of decades, giving us choices beyond the Microsoft/Apple duopoly that chained our desktops (and forcing the duopoly to open up a lot) and smashing the big-iron vendor cartel that owned our servers, but as the world shifts from desktop to web-hosted software, it can&#8217;t take us much further.</p>
</div>
<div id="next">
<h3>Your data is the next big battle</h3>
<p>Open Source will still matter, of course (especially for server-side work), but it won&#8217;t be an important battle ground any more.  Until we can convince (or force) web sites to embrace and standardize on Open Data formats &mdash; XML, JSON, or even CSV, as appropriate &mdash; we will be in some ways even more locked in than we were in the bad old desktop days.  Celebrate Open Source&#8217;s victory, by all means, but get ready for an even bigger and bloodier battle over the next 10-20 years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even if you don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;m Christian, I promise not to take offense. I&#8217;m tired of watching friends, neighbours, and colleagues tying themselves in knots trying to think of a culturally-sensitive thing to say to me  (usually &#8220;have a nice holiday&#8221; or something similar).  You&#8217;re also welcome to wish me a happy version of any other holiday, religious or not &#8212; I prefer a world where we celebrate all cultures and religions to one where we pretend religion and culture don&#8217;t exist.  I live in a big, multi-ethnic city, and my acquaintances who are Muslim, Sikh, Jewish, or Hindu seem to have no problem using the <strong>C</strong> word, so the awkwardness seems limited to, well, Christians (or at least people whose ancestors were Christians).</p>
<p>Actually, since my ancestors <em>were</em> Christian, I&#8217;d also be happy if you wished me a &#8220;Merry Xmas&#8221;.  During the 70&#8217;s or 80&#8217;s, there was a wrong-headed reaction against this spelling, along the lines of &#8220;put the <em>Christ</em> back in Christmas.&#8221;  That&#8217;s not an &#8220;X&#8221;, folks &#8212; it&#8217;s the Greek letter <em>Chi</em>, which starts the word &#8220;Christ&#8221;.  &#8220;X&#8221; was very much used among early Christians as an abbreviation for the title of the person they believed was the son of God, with the added bonus that the letter makes the shape of the cross they believed he died on.</p>
<p>So, on that note, Merry Christmas, everyone!</p>

<p>Like many Canadians, I grew up in the Protestant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Church_of_Canada">United Church of Canada</a> [Wikipedia] and then stopped going after confirmation, though in my case it was not apathy but teenage experimentation with Christian fundamentalism (I didn&#8217;t inhale, much) that kept me away. Today, while our American cousins to the south enjoy their election day &#8212; at least, those Americans with access to working voting machines &#8212; I&#8217;d like people to reconsider some of their negative stereotypes about religious organizations by taking a look at the United Church&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061107/united_church_061107/20061107?hub=TopStories">new ad campaign</a>, featuring such attractions as a shopping mall Jesus, a bible filled with Post-it bookmarks, and whipped cream intended for non-gastronomic purposes.  Enjoy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I signed up for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a> a while ago, put EUR 10 into my account, and made a few calls.  It was cute, it worked, but after a couple of experiments I couldn&#8217;t see the big deal.  After all, Skype lags by a second or two (like the old trans-Atlantic cables), it has poor sound quality even compared to my cell phone, and phone calls in North America, even long distance, are so close to free that Skype hardly matters.</p>
<p>Over here in the Amsterdam this week, it&#8217;s a different story.  My North American cell phone doesn&#8217;t work (of course), calling from the hotel is ridiculously expensive (even calling a toll-free number), and there are very few public phones.  All I need is a wireless Internet signal, though, and I can call home on Skype to my heart&#8217;s content for (literally) pennies.  Even more importantly, I can call North American toll-free numbers directly, something that&#8217;s not otherwise possible at any cost from Europe.  OK, now I get the excitement around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VoIP</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">Instant messaging</a> (aka <em>chat</em>) has been around  in various guises a lot longer than Skype, but I&#8217;m in my fourties, and thus, a little too old ever to have used it socially. What finally changed that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google&#8217;s</a> integration of IM right into their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail">webmail service</a>.  While I&#8217;m reading my GMail, a little green light goes on when anyone I know is reading at the same time (the joys of AJAX).  After midnight Amsterdam time last night, I ended up with three chat windows open &#8212; one for my spouse, and one for each of my kids &#8212; carrying on three separate private conversations about how their days had gone.  I could have called on Skype, of course, but I couldn&#8217;t have talked privately to all three at once, and I wouldn&#8217;t have known when they were all free without those little green lights.  While typing furiously and switching among windows, I got perhaps a tiny taste of what it&#8217;s like to be a hyperactive 16-year-old girl.</p>
<h2>XTech, AJAX, and Rails</h2>
<p>Speaking of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a>, IDEAlliance staff has told me that the AJAX developer&#8217;s day here at <a href="http://www.xtech.org/">XTech 2006</a> has been so popular that it&#8217;s almost overwhelmed, with a huge number of last-minute walk-ins.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails">Rails</a> tutorials have also been popular.  There&#8217;s obviously a lot of demand for AJAX and Rails information over here &#8212; good job, Edd.</p>
<p>Now, back to age-appropriate communications.  When&#8217;s the penknife to sharpen my quill? &#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As most of you probably already know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown">Dan Brown</a>, author of the (unintentionally) hilarious novel <cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code">The Da Vinci Code</a></cite>, has won a copyright-violation case suit brought against him by authors of one of the books he used as a source (<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2006/04/07/davinci-lawsuit.html?ref=rss">CBC story</a>).</p>
<p>When trying to explain the absurdity of software patents, I&#8217;ve often used the example of books and movies.  Imagine if someone could patent the idea of, say, a guy starting out badly and then redeeming himself, or of a man and woman appearing to hate each-other and then falling in love.  While the Brown case used copyright rather than patent law, it came terrifyingly close to my example, since two authors (who do not deserve to be named or linked to here) accused Brown of stealing the <em>idea</em> of Jesus marrying Mary Magdalene and having kids, etc. from their book.  Fortunately, the judge seems to have laughed the plaintiffs out of court, even referring to them as &#8220;authors of pretend historical books.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something else here that you might initially miss, however.  Not only did the plaintiffs lose, but the judge <strong>ordered them to pay Brown&#8217;s publisher&#8217;s legal costs</strong> &#8212; that&#8217;s very common in Canada, and apparently also in Great Britain (where this case took place), especially when a judge believes that a lawsuit was unjustified.  The two authors who sued Brown will have to pay a few hundred thousand pounds now.  If U.S. courts commonly did the same thing, then maybe spurious law suits fishing for big settlements would be a lot less common down there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.chevyapprentice.com/view.php?country=us&amp;uniqueid=0e88676e-1244-1029-98eb-0013724ff5a7">this SUV commercial parody</a>, sent to me by an acquaintance (quickly, before GM pulls the link).</p>
<p>General Motors has a <a href="http://www.chevyapprentice.com/index.php">new online marketing campaign</a> for the Chevy Apprentice, where you can design your own TV commercial and play it back using Flash.  You can also enter your commercial into a contest.  Inevitably &#8212; especially with the SUV&#8217;s reputation (deserved or undeserved) as a poster child for environmental destruction and a high roll-over fatality rate &#8212; such a contest can attract, say, less-than serious entries.</p>
<p>The parody linked above is side-splittingly funny, but I&#8217;m posting about it here because the Flash always begins with the message &#8220;Loading XML&#8230;&#8221; That led me to a few observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>GM is using XML to save the scripts for the customized commercials (does any Flash-type know how to get at the raw XML?  I&#8217;d love to see the markup.)</li>
<li>GM is <em>advertising</em> the fact that they&#8217;re using XML to save the commercials (or else Flash is forcing them to, but I don&#8217;t remember seeing that message with other Flash animations).</li>
<li>Perhaps XML is so cool that people want to point out that they&#8217;re using it.</li>
<li>Or, perhaps GM wants to make sure that XML gets the blame if the commercial loads slowly.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="400" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/1950%2527s_television.jpg/800px-1950%2527s_television.jpg" align="right" /></p>
<p>Statistics Canada has just published <a href="http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/060331/d060331b.htm">statistics about Canadian television viewing in Fall 2004</a> (<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2006/03/31/canadian-tvviewing.html?ref=rss">via CBC</a>).  I loved TV once, and as I sit by its deathbed, I&#8217;m torn between wanting to hold onto it just a little longer and hoping for its suffering to end.</p>
<p>Not many years ago, before panicking about the Internet became fashionable, Moms-Who-Like-To-Worry were concerned that their kids were watching too much TV.  Many moms even restricted or banned TV in their houses, ensuring that their kids would spend most of their after-school and weekend time at friends houses doing <em>&lt;so-called&gt;</em>homework<em>&lt;/so-called&gt;</em>.  Well, it turns out that by the middle of this decade, kids couldn&#8217;t care less &#8212; Canadian teens spent only about 12.9 hours/week watching TV, half the average for all ages.  Men 18-24 spent only 12.4 hours watching TV.  That still represents nearly two hours per day, which seems to me like a lot, but it&#8217;s been declining steadily over the years.</p>
<p>In contrast, now that their kids have left the nest and it&#8217;s safe to turn the TV back on, the Moms-Who-Once-Liked-To-Worry cannot tear themselves away &#8212; Canadian women over 60 watched 35.6 hours of TV a week, which is pretty close to a full-time job in North America or three full-time jobs in France.  I wonder if their now-grown, formerly TV-deprived kids phone home once in a while just to yell &#8220;HYPOCRITE!&#8221; at them.</p>
<p>Teenagers don&#8217;t watch much TV, I think, because it cuts into their text messaging time (except maybe as background noise).  Young males would rather play videogames or misrepresent themselves on MySpace.  So who watches TV?  Same as it always was: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomer">Baby Boomers</a>.  TV was born with the boomers and perhaps it will die with us, even if we don&#8217;t get most of the jokes on the <cite>The Daily Show</cite>.</p>
