										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In web design, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)">Breadcrumbs</a> are those little navigational links you see across the top of some web pages, like</p>

<section id="good">
<h2>Good idea?</h2>
<p>Breadcrumbs let you can see where you are in a web site&#8217;s information hierarchy, and let click to climb up to a more-abstract level. As of 2014-06-13, I use geographical breadcrumbs on OurAirports to let users climb up from looking at a specific airport to looking at the list of all airports in an administrative subdivision (e.g. province/state/governorate), country, or continent. I have haven&#8217;t changed the site design by the time you&#8217;re reading this article, you can try it out for <a href="http://ourairports.com/airports/HECA/">Cairo International Airport</a>.</p>
<p>I like breadcrumbs, because they reflect the way I think. I tend to organise information hierarchically, like a librarian, and breadcrumbs let me find my way around an e-commerce site (for example) without wasting time on frustrating searches. The article “<a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/breadcrumb-navigation-examined-best-practices-examples/">Breadcrumb Navigation Examined: Best Practices &amp; Examples</a>” goes into great detail on different types of breadcrumbs and their benefits.</p>
</section>
<section id="bad">
<h2>Bad idea?</h2>
<p>While I love breadcrumbs, I notice that not many people use them on OurAirports. People almost never click up to see all airports in the same province or country; they really just want to look at a specific airport. Are my breadcrumbs just wasting screen space?</p>
<p>Back in 2008, Jared M. Spool posted an article “<a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/breadcrumbs/">Design Cop-out #2: Breadcrumbs</a>” suggesting that breadcrumbs represent a design failure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest problem is the lack of scent for the other areas of the site. If a user is in need of breadcrumbs because they are in the wrong part of the information tree, what they need most is good scent to the right part of the tree. However, the breadcrumbs only communicate the branch they&#8217;re on — not the branch they need to be on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2011, Shanshan Ma wrote in “<a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/03/10-ways-mobile-sites-are-different-from-desktop-web-sites.php">10 Ways Mobile Sites Are Different from Desktop Web Sites</a>” that even if breadcrumbs belong on desktop web sites, they don&#8217;t belong on mobile ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, breadcrumbs rarely appear on mobiles sites, and there is usually no necessity for them. Limited space is one reason breadcrumbs are uncommon on mobile sites. But the main factor is that the design of mobile sites prevents users from having to go too deep into a hierarchy to find what they are looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h2>What do you think?</h2>
<p>Do breadcrumbs perform an important function in modern web design, or are they just a crutch for bad design?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Lord Byron" src="https://quoderat.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lord-byron1.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></p>
<p>So what happened last week?  Did Google <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/opinion/08cringeley.html">backtrack after getting caught trying to be evil</a> about net neutrality and the mobile internet, or were they a <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Government-IT/The-Truth-About-Google-Verizon-and-Net-Neutrality-371606/">victim of a misunderstanding</a> (gleefully amplified by blood-thirsty Apple and RIM supporters)?</p>
<p><strong>Net neutrality</strong> is a crucial issue for those of us who care about open information.  We believe that the Internet is a public thoroughfare, where every information provider has the same access.  Competing web sites shouldn&#8217;t have their traffic slowed down because Google or Microsoft paid more money to Verizon, Rogers, or Bell, any more than you should have to pull to the side of the road to let someone in a more expensive car pass you.</p>
<h3>Carriers in search of a business plan</h3>
<p>For obvious reasons, the Internet providers don&#8217;t see it that way. They&#8217;ve ended up stuck in the rut of commodity service, with the inevitable race to the bottom for price, and are desperate to find some new revenue.  The mobile Internet providers are a little better off because they can at least lock customers into three-year contracts by giving them subsidized smartphones, but it&#8217;s still clear that someone like Verizon would be thrilled be able to take a big bag of money from Google in exchange for letting Google sites load a little faster than anyone else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that that&#8217;s not what Google was trying to do.</p>
<h3>Neutral in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">what sense</span>?</h3>
<p>The Google-Verizon kerfuffle draws attention to a different, and trickier part of the debate.  What if, instead of discriminating by provider (Google vs Facebook), carriers discriminated by traffic <em>type</em>? In other words, what if streaming audio and video got priority handling to avoid jerky playback, while e-mail was delayed an extra 2-4 seconds? All streaming video would get the same treatment, whether it comes from YouTube or a student&#8217;s dorm-room start-up, and all e-mail would get the same treatment, whether it&#8217;s from IBM or a LOL cats fan list.</p>
<p>According to Google&#8217;s CEO, Eric Schmidt, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/fcc-on-net-neutrality-yes-we-can.ars">this is what Verizon and Google were talking about all along</a>: not favouring one provider over another, but favouring one <em>content type</em> over another.</p>
<h3>Is it still evil?</h3>
<p>I expect that many people who support net neutrality for providers won&#8217;t feel so strongly about net neutrality for content types, because it doesn&#8217;t have the same appearance of unfairness.</p>
<p>Going back to the thoroughfare analogy, we have sidewalks where only pedestrians are allowed, paths where only cyclists are allowed, crossings that pedestrians aren&#8217;t allowed to use, and superhighways where only motor vehicles are allowed.  Buses and carpoolers are sometimes allowed to use a faster lane, trucks are sometimes required to stay in the slower lanes, and so on.  Why can&#8217;t we have different lanes for different kinds of network traffic, too?</p>
<h3>Net neutrality makes sense for content types, too</h3>
<p>There are, however, four compelling arguments in favour of net neutrality by content type as well as provider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pandora&#8217;s Box</strong> — it seems straight-forward enough to give streaming video priority over email, but how far might carriers take it?  Will carriers throttle IM during the next G8 summit to make it harder for protesters to organize?  Will government regulators prefer content types that are more popular among the old than the young?</li>
<li><strong>Business/content-type alignment</strong> — as the owner of the world&#8217;s top video site, Google has a strong interest in making video on the mobile web faster, even if it means that its competitors&#8217; videos are faster too. This kind of thing could turn evil fast — imagine Adobe and Apple in a bidding war to determine whether Flash should be delivered faster or slower than other content types, or the recording industry lobbying to throttle bittorrent so much that it becomes useless.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong> — the Internet already existed when HTML and HTTP arrived on the scene 20 years ago.  If the net hadn&#8217;t been neutral then, perhaps priority would have gone to important existing protocols like telnet and FTP, and HTTP (and HTML) might have been slow enough to turn off early adopters.  We don&#8217;t know what The Next Big Thing will be, but we do know that regulators respond slowly to change.  Why shut the door on innovation?</li>
<li><strong>Routing around censorship</strong> — seriously, how long will it take a few enterprising developers to realize that they can build an &#8220;accelerated download&#8221; app that allows other traffic to masquerade as video (or whatever has top priority).  Seconds?  Less?  You can make anything look like anything else on the Internet, and everyone thinks that his/her traffic is most important.</li>
</ol>
<h3>It&#8217;s OK to be wrong sometimes</h3>
<p>Google is a company that <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/08/failure-is-always-option-at-google.html">embraces failure</a>, which, perhaps, is why it has so many successes: Google puts products out early, lets us play with them, then feeds the ones that succeed (e.g. Gmail) and kills the ones that don&#8217;t (e.g. Wave).</p>
<p>Perhaps Google is willing to try the same thing with ideas — they&#8217;re not necessarily evil for suggesting dropping net neutrality for content types, but they <em>are</em> wrong.  Let&#8217;s treat the whole thing as a failed project and move on, concentrating on making the net (mobile or desktop) faster for all providers, and all content types.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my university studies, I first encountered the idea of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Progress">Myth of Progress</a> — in 19th and 20th centuries a lot of people assumed that the world generally gets better each generation (aside from occasional blips like depressions or world wars), with less bigotry, better medicine, new technology, etc., but there&#8217;s no guarantee that any next generation will build on and improve the accomplishments of the previous one, and history&#8217;s movement may be more akin to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Case in point:</strong> in the information technology world, the greatest accomplishment of the most talented coders and business people in GenX was replacing the Baby Boomers&#8217; nasty old platform-dependent shrink-wrapped computer applications with open web applications that could run anywhere, from a Windows desktop to a Linux cell phone.  Write once, run all over the place on any hardware/OS you want.  GMail instead of Eudora.  Wikipedia instead of Encarta.  Cool, eh?</p>
<p><strong>So GenY comes along</strong> and says &#8220;hey: instead of encouraging people to browse the web with open standards, let&#8217;s build proprietary applications that run on only one type of mobile phone.  And we&#8217;ll allow only <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">one store</a></strong> to sell those applications for each type of phone, and every proprietary, platform-specific app will have to be preapproved and precensored by the phone manufacturer, who will extort^H^H^H^H^H^H be gladly offered a cut of sales.&#8221;  Even Microsoft in its monopolistic hey-day — before it became the toothless lion it is today — never had the balls to try anything like that with Windows apps.</p>
<p><strong>Who, ten years ago</strong>, would have predicted an IT catastrophe like this after so much progress and hope? It&#8217;s enough to make a person cry.  Let&#8217;s encourage those GenY&#8217;ers who taken up the torch and continue to work on the dream of an open web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re writing a business plan for your personal startup (the tech equivalent of the <em>Great American Novel</em> that every hack journalist plans to write), a report for your customers, or a proposal for your managers, sooner or later you&#8217;re going to have to describe a <strong>customer problem</strong> — the justification for creating a product or launching a project.</p>
<p>Frankly, the majority of customer problem descriptions I&#8217;ve seen and heard — including those I&#8217;ve been involved in — have been either poorly thought out or complete B.S.  I know I won&#8217;t always be allowed to use this, but as a consultant and as a poor fool who still dreams of his own startup, I&#8217;ve written a checklist of six criteria that a <em>real</em> customer problem must meet:</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses the <strong>customer&#8217;s language</strong>, not yours — if any words or ideas need to be defined or explained, then it&#8217;s probably not really a customer problem.</li>
<li>It describes a <strong>business need</strong> — it should not mention the proposed technical solution (such as a social network, CMS, etc.).</li>
<li>It is <strong>recognizable</strong> — the customer is already familiar with the problem or with a very similar one, and doesn&#8217;t need to be convinced that the problem exists (though she might not be aware of its severity).</li>
<li>It is <strong>quantifiable</strong> — even if you can&#8217;t assign a number yet, it is the kind of problem that has a cost expressed in <em>concrete</em> units such as money, time, subscriptions, support calls, page views, etc.</li>
<li>It is <strong>compelling</strong> — you can demonstrate potential benefits, savings, etc. that justify the time, cost, and effort for the customer to try to solve it.</li>
<li>It is <strong>succinct</strong> — you can <del>describe</del> <ins>summarize</ins> the problem meaningfully in a single, short sentence (of course, you&#8217;re always free to elaborate it somewhere else).</li>
</ol>
<p>The passing grade on this checklist is 100%. If only one checklist item is missing, the problem is likely just wishful thinking — if your product or project succeeds, it will be despite your idea of the problem, not because of it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It&#8217;s actually easy to come up with problem descriptions that meet all six criteria; what&#8217;s hard is coming up with problem descriptions that meet all six criteria <em>and</em> have credible technical solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a></strong> lets members tag airports to create different kinds of maps.  I&#8217;ve created two maps that show very vividly where the intersections of people, money, and land occur in the world.</p>
<h2>Welcome to the club &#8230;</h2>
<p>The first tag, <strong><var><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/top150/">top150</a></var></strong>, shows the world&#8217;s 150 busiest airports by passenger traffic (as of 2007).  Central Africa has lots of people, but not much money, so it&#8217;s empty.  Australia and Canada have high per-capita incomes but a low population density, so they also appear mostly empty in the map, with only a handful of top-150 airports each.  The U.S. has a lot of land but also a lot of money and a lot of people, so it&#8217;s very full.  India and the Persian Gulf countries are starting to fill up, as incomes rise and more people travel.</p>
<h2>&#8230; but not <em>this</em> club</h2>
<p>The second tag, <strong><var><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/top30/">top30</a></var></strong>, shows a much more exclusive club, the world&#8217;s 30 busiest airports by passenger traffic.  These are the absolute busiest hubs, and it takes a rich <em>and</em> populous city or country to support one.  Not by accident, fully half of these airports (15) are in the United States, and 8 more are in Western Europe, leaving only 7 for the rest of the world to share.</p>
<p>In this club, the 1.3 billion citizens of China are represented by only two airports (including Hong Kong), and the 1.2 billion citizens of India are not represented at all.  Canada and Australia also don&#8217;t make the cut (too few people).</p>
<p>Of course, there are other considerations: aside from its money, land, and people, the heavy air passenger traffic in the U.S. may also reflect its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak">horrendous rail system</a>.</p>

<p><em>See also John Cowan&#8217;s comment below, for a different (personal) interpretation of Google&#8217;s terms of service.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Google Maps won&#8217;t show me satellite imagery this morning.</p>
<p>Google has recently set up a system to try to autodetect and block bots scraping their system, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google_Web_Search_Help-Troubleshooting/browse_frm/thread/2ec0b8abccca19e4">it isn&#8217;t working very well</a> — people are getting blocked even from Google Search simply because they have too many (human-generated) queries passing through the same proxy.</p>
<p>This morning, I suddenly discovered a different problem: the satellite view in Google Maps has stopped working for me — I get the &#8220;don&#8217;t have imagery at this zoom level for this region&#8221; error everywhere, at every zoom level.  I can still see maps and terrain, but not satellite pics, and I noticed the host <code>sorry.google.com</code> setting a lot of cookies.</p>
<p>Is Google&#8217;s satellite imagery down for everyone else this morning, or has their software decided that I&#8217;m a bot trying to scrape satellite imagery?</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>I was right — Google&#8217;s software had decided that I was a bot.  They have a test link directly to a satellite to see if you&#8217;re being blocked:</p>
<p><a href="http://khm0.google.com/kh?v=31&amp;hl=en&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;z=1&amp;s=">http://khm0.google.com/kh?v=31&amp;hl=en&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;z=1&amp;s=</a></p>
<p>It took me to <a href="http://sorry.google.com/sorry/?continue=http://khm0.google.com/kh%3Fv%3D31%26hl%3Den%26x%3D0%26y%3D0%26z%3D1%26s%3D">this page</a>.  I was able to renable access simply by entering a CAPTCHA.</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>I wrote a couple of months ago about <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2008/07/27/detecting-overzoom-in-google-maps/">how to detect overzoom in Google Maps</a>.  My guess is that the overzoom protection in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> — automatically zooming out every 4 seconds until there were actual satellite tiles available — triggered to bot alert, and I&#8217;ve disabled the feature for now.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very bad news for any mashup that uses JavaScript to do more sophisticated things with Google Maps, like, say, panning at regular intervals.  Google&#8217;s bot detection seems to be extremely naive, and any repeated action at regular intervals will fire it off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late in summer 2007, I set up a dedicated Linux Ubuntu server at a site in San Diego to host <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> and my consulting site, <a href="http://www.megginson.com/">megginson.com</a>.  The ISP has had some net outages, but the Ubuntu server itself has kept on chugging through.  Here&#8217;s the uptime:</p>
<pre> 11:18:31 up 335 days,  7:12,  1 user,  load average: 0.05, 0.06, 0.01</pre>
<p>Since the ISP set the computer up with a minimal Ubuntu install and gave me the access info, it has run continuously — I know I should install an updated kernel some day, but it&#8217;s hard to bring myself to do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the search logs for <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a>, I noticed a series of searches for URLs:</p>
<pre>http://www.feliciano.de/Webgalerie/bilder/Italy/une/yiwul/
http://www.unduetretoccaate.it/codice/aseje/wocobo/
http://www.altaiseer-eg.com/ar/articles/jed/umut/</pre>
<p>At first, I thought they might be a kind of link spam — some sites display recent searches — but when I checked one of the URLs, I found something totally unexpected:</p>
<pre>php echo md5("just_a_test");?&gt;</pre>
<p>They&#8217;re all the same.  This is almost certainly related to passwords: is there a known flaw in a PHP content-management system like Drupal, or in the PHP API for a search engine like Lucene, where this would do some damage, or is it just a test probing for weaknesses?  Is the PHP code supposed to be served up literally like that, or should I be seeing the MD5 instead?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m using a single dedicated server to host <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">ourairports.com</a>, <a href="http://www.megginson.com/">megginson.com</a>, and a couple of minor domains.  OurAirports is a database-heavy application using (currently) a MySQL v.5 database hosted on the same server.  I&#8217;ll offload the database to a separate server if traffic keeps increasing, but as long as I&#8217;m getting compliments from tech people for my fast response times (mainly thanks to MySQL&#8217;s built-in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/query-cache.html">query caching</a>), there&#8217;s no point paying for extra hardware.</p>
<h3>Uptime</h3>
<p>My ISP set up the server for me last summer with a bare-bones Ubuntu distro, then I installed the extra packages I needed using aptitude over ssh.  Since then, I&#8217;ve done many Ubuntu in-place upgrades, rolled out hundreds of changes and upgrades to the web apps and dozens to the database schema (some very significant), and upgraded WordPress n-teen times.  Check this out:</p>
<pre>$ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptime">uptime</a>
 13:08:31 up 175 days, 10:02,  1 user,  load average: 0.23, 0.06, 0.02</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s right — since my ISP first set up the server with a basic Ubuntu system, I&#8217;ve <em>never</em> had to restart it.  In fact, if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache</a> and mod_php (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP5</a>) had &#8216;uptime&#8217; commands, they&#8217;d show almost the same amount of time, since I restarted them only to make configuration changes in the first few days of setting up the server (unless apt stopped them to install a newer version during one of my upgrades).  I&#8217;ve restarted MySQL more recently, but again, only to experiment with configuration changes (especially for fulltext).</p>
<h3>-1 for being cool, +10 for having a life</h3>
<p>Using reliable old technologies like Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP doesn&#8217;t win any cool points, but it certainly makes maintaining a web server and its applications easy.  I can go on vacation, for example, without worrying about being able to get online to fix or restart my server every couple of days.  I don&#8217;t have to stay up until 3:00 am on Sunday night so that I can take the server offline to roll out new software versions or bug fixes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptitude_(program)">aptitude</a> installs any security fixes in place).  I spend lots of time with my family.  I go to my kids&#8217; school concerts.  I learned banjo and mandolin (why not, since I have the free time?).</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s the developer, not the language</h3>
<p>And yes, my PHP web app <em>is</em> easy to maintain and extend, because I designed it to be that way (I can often implement, test and roll out new features in a matter of minutes, even when they require database schema changes) — it&#8217;s the developer, not the programming language, that determines the quality and maintainability of an app.  A lot of newbies use PHP, so there&#8217;s a lot of bad PHP out there, but the same can be said for any language, <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">even Ruby</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love Google Maps and their API, and am using it extensively in my new web site <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a>. However, there are two problems that keep coming up for using Google Maps with an aviation application:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Usgs_map_mercator.svg/413px-Usgs_map_mercator.svg.png" alt="[Diagram of Mercator projection]" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Google Maps uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator Projection</a>, grossly distorting the northern and southern parts of the world, and cutting off the area near the poles so that a few of the Antarctic airports don&#8217;t show up on my maps at all.  I can understand the reasons for their choice, with simple panning and tile paging and a rectangular area, but it can make things look pretty silly sometimes (such as Greenland and Africa appearing the same size).</li>
<li>Google Maps does not provide an API call to draw a great-circle path.  This seems to me to be almost a no-brainer, and it&#8217;s especially important in a Mercator projection, where the apparently straight paths drawn by the API are anything but (especially east-west).  After messing with some out-of-date third-party libraries, I finally found some JavaScript at one site that does a good job on efficient, approximate great-circle paths, and am waiting to hear from the author about terms for reuse.  Google might want to just go ahead and add this, though.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Usgs_map_lambert_conformal_conic.PNG" alt="[Diagram of Mercator projection]" /></p>
<p>Aviation charts mostly use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_conformal_conic_projection">Lambert conformal conic projection</a>, which ensures that distances are preserved (any two points the same distance apart on the chart are the same distance apart in the real world); however, by definition this projection can&#8217;t show more than half the world at once, and generally shows much less than that, so it wouldn&#8217;t work for something like Google Maps.</p>

<p>Recently, we&#8217;ve had a few postings about women in computing (or the lack thereof) — see <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/14/DevChix">Bray</a>, <a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/archives/2007/06/14/tech-women/">Wood</a>, <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/30">Tenison</a>, and <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/20/Women">Bray (again)</a>, all ignited by a <a href="http://www.devchix.com/2007/06/09/let%e2%80%99s-all-evolve-past-this-the-barriers-women-face-in-tech-communities/">piece in devChix</a>.</p>
<p>These postings all assume that we need to <em>do something</em> to pull more women into coding.  Why?  Do we think there are there lots of women would be happy coding, but aren&#8217;t smart enough or motivated enough to choose the right careers for themselves, or are too timid to deal with any barriers unless someone comes along and dismantles them first?</p>
<div id="market">
<h3>Listen to the market</h3>
<p>In an age where we&#8217;ve come to trust central planning less and the free market more, why not try to learn from the labour market instead of trying to push it ways it doesn&#8217;t want to go?</p>
<p>If we assume that the majority of working women <em>are</em> smart, strong, motivated, and brave, then we can also assume that they have good reasons for choosing their careers.  And in fact, it turns out that their track record isn&#8217;t bad.  For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, women were grossly underrepresented in manufacturing and overrepresented in lower-paying service-industry jobs like retail.  But when manufacturing starting offshoring in the 1980s and 1990s, it was the women who were still working (often as managers, at this point), while the men were at home, depressed, collecting welfare cheques or trying to retrain for jobs that paid a fraction of what they used to earn.</p>
<p>Now, while there&#8217;s lots of work connected with tech, we see pure coding increasingly being offshored, the same way that manufacturing was 20 years ago.  There&#8217;s no shortage of women working in jobs connected with computers, but instead of coding, many women choose onsite consulting, training, marketing, and other jobs that are not only social but require face time with customers, and as a result, are much more difficult to offshore.</p>
<p>Of course, if you absolutely love coding, like I do (and most of the people reading this do), you&#8217;re going to work hard to try to find a way to keep doing it, whether you&#8217;re a man or a woman.  But if you don&#8217;t feel that burning love, why let yourself be dragged kicking and screaming into an industry where salaries are falling, jobs are fleeing, hours are increasing (bye bye weekends!), and workers are increasingly treated as interchangeable cogs on a development assembly line, without even the (questionable) union protection their parents had in their factory jobs 20-30 years ago?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dare Obasanjo just put up a posting with the title <cite><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=69141977-7514-443d-800b-1f95c1ff8dbe">Open Source is Dead</a></cite>.  Dare does happen to be a Microsoft employee, but his posting is none of the standard anti-Linux/OpenOffice/Apache/Firefox FUD.  Instead, he voices a question that&#8217;s been floating around for a while:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; how much value do you think there is to be had from a snapshot of the source code for eBay or Facebook being made available? This is one area where Open Source offers no solution to the problem of vendor lock-in.
</p></blockquote>
<div id="locked">
<h3>Let me out!!!</h3>
<p>In other words, as the Web replaces Microsoft Windows as the world&#8217;s favorite desktop/laptop software platform (it may be there already), what good is Open Source to ordinary computer user? Even if a web site happens to be built on Open Source software (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a> stack), I&#8217;m still locked in:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I move my address book and archived e-mail from Hotmail to Yahoo or GMail?</li>
<li>How can I move my blog (with all postings and comments) from Blogger to Bloglines or WordPress?</li>
<li>How can someone move her contact list and comments from MySpace to Facebook?</li>
<li>How can a buyer in Yahoo&#8217;s auction thingy verify my reputation on eBay?</li>
<li>How can I move my old flight plans from Aeroplanner to FBOWeb?</li>
<li>How can I move my sales contacts and data from Salesforce.com to Highrise?</li>
<li>How can I move my pictures <em>with their tags</em> from Flickr to Smugmug?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="open">
<h3>A crack of light under the door</h3>
<p>These are huge problems, and the solution is probably going to have a lot more to do with <strong>Open Data</strong> than with Open Source.  There are already a couple of minor successes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog reading sites almost universally support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> import and export, so that you can save the list of blogs you read from one site and move it to another.</li>
<li>Online wordprocessors and spreadsheets, of course, support the Microsoft Office formats and/or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a> formats and/or RTF and CSV. </li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s not much, though.  Open Source (and its predecessor buzzword, <em>Free Software</em>) have been very important over the past couple of decades, giving us choices beyond the Microsoft/Apple duopoly that chained our desktops (and forcing the duopoly to open up a lot) and smashing the big-iron vendor cartel that owned our servers, but as the world shifts from desktop to web-hosted software, it can&#8217;t take us much further.</p>
</div>
<div id="next">
<h3>Your data is the next big battle</h3>
<p>Open Source will still matter, of course (especially for server-side work), but it won&#8217;t be an important battle ground any more.  Until we can convince (or force) web sites to embrace and standardize on Open Data formats &mdash; XML, JSON, or even CSV, as appropriate &mdash; we will be in some ways even more locked in than we were in the bad old desktop days.  Celebrate Open Source&#8217;s victory, by all means, but get ready for an even bigger and bloodier battle over the next 10-20 years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Via <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/05/Languages-Today">Ongoing</a>, I read some interesting discussions of programming languages &#8212; mainly Python vs. Ruby, with most people happily dumping on Java.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/anti-anti-hype.html">Steve Yegge</a>, in particular, argues that language success is based mainly on marketing, and that Python is doomed to obscurity because of the community&#8217;s lack of marketing savvy.</p>
<h2>The programming language cycle</h2>
<p>While I agree that Python probably is doomed to perpetual obscurity at this point, I think that Yegge&#8217;s focus on marketing is oversimplistic; instead, I&#8217;d argue that there&#8217;s a self-perpetuating cycle at work for successful programming languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elite (guru) developers notice too many riff-raff using their current programming language, and start looking for something that will distinguish them better from their mediocre colleagues.</li>
<li>Elite developers take their shopping list of current annoyances and look for a new, little-known language that apparently has fewer of them.</li>
<li>Elite developers start to drive the development of the new language, contributing code, writing libraries, etc., then evangelize the new language.</li>
<li>Sub-elite (senior) developers follow the elite developers to the new language, creating a market for books, training, etc., and also accelerating the development and testing of the language.</li>
<li>Sub-elite developers, who have huge influence (elite developers tend to work in isolation on research projects rather than on production development teams), begin pushing for the new language in the workplace.</li>
<li>The huge mass of regular developers realize that they have to start buying books and taking courses to learn a new language.</li>
<li>Elite developers notice too many riff-raff using their current programming language, and start looking for something that will distinguish them better from their mediocre colleagues.</li>
</ol>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that there&#8217;s no step here called &#8220;marketing&#8221;; instead, there are several distinct stages of evangelization and community building. Major vendors (other than the language&#8217;s owner, if it&#8217;s a vendor) will start to notice the language once the second wave (sub-elite) developers arrive, and IT managers will notice it because of books, magazine articles, and pressure from the high-end developers.  Some &#8212; possibly a lot &#8212; of marketing will come out of those steps, but it is as much a <em>result</em> of the language&#8217;s success as a <em>cause</em>.</p>
<h2>Points of failure</h2>
<p>In this cycle, there are a few highly probably points of failure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> A new language might not be at the right stage of development (too raw, or too stale) at the time when elite developers decide to make a mass migration.</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong> If the new language&#8217;s features don&#8217;t answer the elite developers&#8217; annoyance list, not enough of them will migrate to it.</li>
<li><strong>Openness:</strong> Elite developers are used to having a lot of influence, and if the new language&#8217;s development process does not allow them sufficient say in the new language&#8217;s evolution, they will leave before they attract enough sub-elite developers.</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Sub-elite developers might find the language unsuitable for day-to-day production use, especially if enough basic tools are not available (libraries, testing, debugging, GUI tools, performance measurement, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>General acceptance:</strong> Regular developers might object to the new language and sabotage projects using it, either by producing poor-quality code or by missing deadlines (and blaming the new language in both cases).</li>
</ul>
<p>Most programming languages stumble over one or more of these &#8212; it&#8217;s as much luck as clever design when a language like C++ or Java makes it past the hurdles and into the workplace.  Success tends to draw more success, money draws more money, etc.</p>
<p>The final and most important point here is that a programming language&#8217;s perceived coolness will always suffer from its success.  Java cannot possibly still be cool when there are thousands of regular developers slaving away in the bowels of ACME Widgets using it to write enterprise applications.  If, in fact, Ruby displaces Java in the enterprise (which may not happen, since Ruby has no advantage over Java to match Java&#8217;s memory-management advantage over C++), it will suffer precisely the same fate, and we can expect Bruce Tate to write a book <cite>Beyond Ruby</cite> in five years or so.</p>
<p>By that measure, Python&#8217;s very failure is a kind of success &#8212; as long as it never really becomes takes hold in the workplace it will always carry a small degree of distinction with it, and at least a few elite developers won&#8217;t feel pressured to move on.  Like a movie or band that never becomes too popular, Python will hang onto its snob appeal.</p>
