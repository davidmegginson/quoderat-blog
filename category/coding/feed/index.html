										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2013/07/17/transitioning-to-a-mobile-centric-world/">http://abovethecrowd.com/2013/07/17/transitioning-to-a-mobile-centric-world/</a></p>
<p>This article argues that the verdict is in, and users want apps, not mobile web sites.&nbsp; My friend and colleague Michael Roberts (who, I suspect, is neutral in the debate) shared this link on Google+, and &#8211; as if to prove Mr Gurley&#8217;s thesis &#8211; I read his posting in the Android G+ app, not the mobile site.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here is the comment I left:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interesting piece &#8211; thanks, Michael . He&#8217;s absolutely right that people prefer apps to the browser for common tasks, but I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s got the whole story.&nbsp; For example, like most people, I currently read G+, Facebook, and Twitter in the dedicated mobile apps rather than in the browser.&nbsp; However, a large plurality (if not majority) of interesting posts to those services are actually links back out into the web, so the result of of reading a tweet is generally opening not a dedicated app, but a web site.</p>
<p>Case in point &#8211; we&#8217;re both reacting to a pro-app/anti-browser article, but the only reason we know about it is that you were able to share a web link in your G+ post.&nbsp; If Mr. Gurley had created a &#8220;GurleyPosts&#8221; app for his thoughts, then (a) most people probably wouldn&#8217;t have it installed, and (b) you wouldn&#8217;t have been able to pass a link from iOS that I could use to read it on Android.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, for something I do a lot (read Facebook, check the weather, play a game, get driving directions) I will tend to use an app.&nbsp; But I <em>won&#8217;t </em>install a dedicated app just to read an article from a magazine or newspaper, and even when I am using an app, I need a <u>link</u> if I&#8217;m going to share it with anyone else.</p>
<p>So in 2013 for mobile, apps are for the tall head of any user&#8217;s activities, and the browser is for the long tail.&nbsp; Of course, every startup thinks it&#8217;s going to be the next Facebook (at least in terms of its importance to the people who use it), but few of them end up there, so the way people are going to find them is by following links from FB, Twitter, Google+, emails, chats, etc.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t give up on that mobile web site quite yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bit over a week ago, I set myself a challenge: develop a mobile app <em>entirely using mobile devices.</em> I must never touch the app with a laptop or desktop computer, for even the most-trivial reason.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a lot of free time in my life, so I&#8217;ve been able to tinker for only an hour here or there, but so far, I&#8217;ve had good success.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>
<p>Here are the ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Android OS (Jellybean) running on a Nexus 7 tablet, with a small Bluetooth keyboard</li>
<li>the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui">Android Integrated Development</a> (AIDE) app, which uses the Eclipse project format and includes a git client</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, for storing my source code</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Progress and gotchas</strong></p>
<p>I decided to create a kind of app that made sense as a mobile app (rather than a web site): a SQL query tool for databases on the device.&nbsp; I&#8217;m calling it &#8220;Sloop-SQL&#8221;, and while my early prototype isn&#8217;t in the Play Store yet, you can grab the Public Domain source from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/davidmegginson/sloop-sql">https://github.com/davidmegginson/sloop-sql</a> and build your own copy with AIDE on your phone/tablet or Eclipse on your laptop/desktop.</p>
<p>The process has worked surprisingly well so far. When I want to test on my phone (rather than my tablet), it takes only a few seconds to do a git pull on the phone, and build and run using AIDE.&nbsp; I also enjoy the simpler AIDE UI over the cluttered Eclipse one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve run into only two significant annoyances:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub doesn&#8217;t have a mobile-friendly site, and their mobile app is severely limited, so it was a bit frustrating creating the repository.</li>
<li>As of Jellybean, Android doesn&#8217;t let apps request permission to see other apps&#8217; logs, so AIDE can&#8217;t show me the app&#8217;s logcat (which includes crash reports from uncaught, top-level exceptions).</li>
</ol>
<p>I could work around the second problem by rooting my N7, but that&#8217;s also cheating. </p>
<p>I hope that the Android team will consider adding the read-logs permission back in &#8212; perhaps backed by a special developer setting &#8212; so that Android can grow into a full software development environment, rather than being nothing more than a development target (like iOS).</p>
