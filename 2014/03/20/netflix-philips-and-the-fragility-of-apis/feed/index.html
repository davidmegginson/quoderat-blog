Exactly (for REST and industry standards). Standards are really, really hard, so you need a big payoff for the person-decades invested in establishing one, but consumer Internet TV devices may have reached that point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One pattern used in application integration to handle the n*m interface problem is to use a canonical data model. Basically this means a standardization of at least the data that is passed between the different applications. In a web API context this implies a  standardization at an industry level, something that I don&#039;t think is really happening at the moment. 
Note that the other problem is a standardization of the operations that can be performed. With a REST style this problem has been somewhat minimized due to a restricted set of operations, i.e. the HTTP verbs.]]></description>

&quot;Nonsense term&quot; might have been too harsh, but when you have a GET request that returns a CSV, XML, or JSON resource, I believe that the term &quot;API&quot; causes more confusion than clarity, and encourages less-experienced developers to wander into overly-complicated morasses like data binding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is why it&#039;s smart of Netflix to be moving in the direction of self-updating clients (HTML clients written in C that load a Netflix URL on each open). This way, you don&#039;t have to deal with TVs or other devices that never get updates. You simply update the page that is loaded to work with the new API.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;the whole point of REST is that it’s not an API (or rather, that its API is HTTP, and most of the semantic burden gets switched from API to payload).&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[One of my jobs at Google was to help product teams to understand that while they could change their web UI at will, they had to have a deprecation policy for their APIs, with lifetimes measured in years, not months or days.

&lt;i&gt;Restful API&lt;/i&gt; considered harmful: Oh pfffft.  All lions are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terrybisson.com/page6/page6.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;made out of meat&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn&#039;t make the phrase &lt;i&gt;stone lion&lt;/i&gt; self-contradictory or useless.  A RESTful API has some of the properties of an API as a stone lion has some of the properties of a lion, which suffices.]]></description>
