					<description><![CDATA[Thank you! This is very helpful!
Followed the instructions exactly and it works great. Now I can edit files on my phone and not lug a laptop around all the time.
I wonder if my desktop .emacs config file will work on the phone, and if it should go in the /sdcard/emacs directory?

					<description><![CDATA[http://emacs.zielm.com still seems down, and because I really wanted org mode on my android tablet I resorted to the app &quot;Linux Deploy&quot;, which enabled me to install debian on my tablet (and ubuntu on my phone!). From there it&#039;s easy to install emacs, just using apt-get as usual. Linux Deploy let me mount my sd card, and I now use foldersync to sync my org files from my dropbox to my sdcard in Android, and then a little bash script to copy them to my home directory in my linux system (permissions are messed up so I can&#039;t seem to edit the files under linux  on the sd card directly without being root). As a side-effect I also have python3 and haskell on my phone and tablet now :D]]></description>

I suggest (temporarily) installing it from the Play store, grabbing the various files, then repackaging them as a zip or tarball. It will be easiest to do on a rooted device, but since the Play package ships with a shell, it will probably be possible to copy the key files from that shell (since it will start as the user that owns the app).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi David, which bt keyboard do you use along with your tablet and emacs? Plus, do you know if it is possible to swap the Ctrl key and the Bloc Maiusc key? This is the way I have my keyboard set up on my computer, and it is one of the few things preventing the transition to tablet from happening!

Thanks in advance, and thanks for your article!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice HowTo. Thx!
Would you also have an idea how to apply your approach to a different terminal app?
More specifically to Jack Palevich&#039;s Terminal Emulator for Android?
I followed your approach for that one, but invoking emacs I get an error message right from the start, saying that the &#039;Terminal type&#039; would not be supported.
I tried putting the terminfo files from http://emacs.zielm.com/data/ into various places on my device and also tried to set TERM and TERMINFO in various ways, but I admittedly I don&#039;t really know what I am doing, and consequentially I cannot get it to work.
Any help would be most appreciated.]]></description>

I think it&#039;s a great idea to do a new native Android port of Emacs for use within Terminal IDE -- I don&#039;t have the time to do it, but I certainly have the time to test, and will happily update this blog post with a link if/when you have one ready.

In the meantime, http://emacs.zielm.com seems to be back up again. We should probably mirror it, in case the site goes offline permanently.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve tried recently using the Emacs app from the Play Store, but the software couldn&#039;t be downloaded because http://emacs.zielm.com/ can&#039;t be resolved.

Anyway, I believe that compiling Emacs against the Android environment (to get the paths correct for an app, and correct library links) and running it from inside a nice terminal in Android is no big conceptual problem. So I might try to do this some time to get an Emacs working even in an unrooted Android.

As for a rooted Android, it has been long known that it is possible to install a GNU/Linux distro into a chroot.

But out of interest, I was also interested to get a running Emacs in an unrooted Android.

As a faster solution (without recompiling Emacs against the Android environment), I&#039;ve used the GNURoot app (with GNURoot Wheezy) which allows to use a GNU/Linux distro like Debian in an unrooted Android. There I could start Emacs, as well as ssh to my computers, and hopefully I&#039;ll be able to use TRAMP, too. (I haven&#039;t yet tried this out.)

The GNURoot app does all this by means of a [&quot;PTRACE container&quot;](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/9188/4319) implemented by [&quot;proot&quot;](http://proot.me/): interception of syscalls and &quot;emulating&quot; what should be done in the different Android and unprivileged environment. (Redirecting paths, faking the root user privileges, etc.)

[It was a while ago when I learned about such projects](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/proot_me/h3rDV8na9kc/4mSCyOsX28UJ).

It&#039;s a pity that source code for GNURoot](https://github.com/corbinlc/gnuroot) seems not to be well documented, so it&#039;s not easy to start hacking with it right away or at least learn how all the things have been compiled and put together from source.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve tried recently using the Emacs app from the Play Store, but the software couldn&#8217;t be downloaded because <a href="http://emacs.zielm.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://emacs.zielm.com/</a> can&#8217;t be resolved.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe that compiling Emacs against the Android environment (to get the paths correct for an app, and correct library links) and running it from inside a nice terminal in Android is no big conceptual problem. So I might try to do this some time to get an Emacs working even in an unrooted Android.</p>
<p>As for a rooted Android, it has been long known that it is possible to install a GNU/Linux distro into a chroot.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to have this on my phone (not for heavy work, but to have some usable text editor to review latex file I happen to have on the phone..). I tried the prepackaged version : was a pain in the ass (insisted to run in lanscape mode, which is an exruciating pain somewhere on a phone...) then uninstalled it.

Then installed Terminal IDE (went fine) then followed your instructions. This hangs at the launch of ~/emacs : clears screen (except for softkeyboard), maints a line of dashes in the all-but-las line of the (usable part of the) screen, displays &quot;using loadpath (/sdcard/emacs/lisp) n the last line (the cursor is right after the closing paren) an hangs ... indefinitely.

Trying to close terminal emulator does not succeds : even after wiping it from the task list, a second consultation of the task list shows it back again. Trying to shutdown all terminals does not succeed either. The only way I found to get rid of it is to reboot the phone.

Any suggestion ? Note : I&#039;m totally ignorant of java and Android : my background is Unix, C, Lisp and R ; I might be a little bit out of my depth here...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi. Thank you for sharing this. I was able to follow every instruction you gave, then when I tried ~/emacs,  I got &quot;Loading emacs-lisp/byte-run (compiled; note, source file is newer)...&quot; Nothing happens after waiting for quite sometime that&#039;s why I terminated Terminal IDE. What should I do? Thank you and more power!]]></description>
